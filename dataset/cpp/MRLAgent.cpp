    @brief Motivated reinforcement learning agent. Provides its own reward structure for self motivation based on novelty.
    Uses a fourier approximator to store the learnt expected reward "value" function.
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Make your own MRLAgent:(WARNING: The motivation wundt function has been tuned for use in head-behaviour, do not change.)
    Follow the template below to implement a Motivated reinforcement learning agent.


    MRLAgent mrlagent;
    mrlagent.setParameters(0.1,0.5,0.5,1.0,1,5);//example parameters
    mrlagent.initialiseAgent(observation_size,number_of_actions,resolution_of_dictionaryApproximator);

    for (number of iterations){
        int action = mrlagent.getActionAndLearn(observation);
        updateWorld(action);
    }

/*! @brief
	Main feature of the MRL agent. The novelty of the state-action is calculated by comparing the expected outcome of the action from the state
	to the actual outcome of the action. The expected outcome is learned as a second dictionary approximator: expectation_map.
	The motivation reward is then calculated by taking the Wundt function of the novelty.
	The agent will receive the highest reward when the expected outcome of an action differs optimally from the actual outcome.
	That is, the expected outcome must not be too different but not too similar to the actual outcome to generate reward.
	This causes the agent to seek out optimally novel experiences: not too complex to learn but not too simple to become 'bored'.
