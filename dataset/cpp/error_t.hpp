// The zero-valued code is the only one that will produce a false in the
// std::error_code bool operator override (false, no error). Each enumeration
// has an independent success code to produce the same type for ternaries.
// Codes of distinct enumerations can be assigned to each other as they are
// all std::system type. However a ternary with two different enums cannot
// assign/return to the same code instance, as the compiler cannot know which
// type to promote. A common success code would make this tedious, and an
// explicit success code for the given category improves consistency as the
// source of a propagated success can be extracted.
