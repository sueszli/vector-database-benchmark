SDx Key Concept :
    
    Split a complex kernel into multiple sub functions using OpenCL (Data
    flow) to build a highly parallel and area efficient kernel which also
    achieves higher clock frequency.

*******************************************************************************/

/*

Kernel Description (Bad Example) :
   
    This is a image processing based application which is mainly designed to showcase
    effectiveness of splitting a complex kernel into multiple sub functions using 
    streams to stream the data between kernels. 
    
    Note :

        Kernel in this file corresponds to bad design where complex operations 
        are present in a single kernel. Major drawback with this design is it lacks
        area efficiency (requires large buffers) and results in inefficient kernel
        design.
        
        1. The optimized version (good example) is present in the file sketch.cpp
        2. The optimized version uses streams to communicate and process efficiently.

    Kernels :
        
        This kernel applies the filters boost, median, sketch and flip on given image.
        
        Inputs/Outputs : 
        
            int *input  ( input)    --> Input image
            int *output (output)    --> Output image
            int  width  ( input)    --> Image width  (max 640)
            int  height ( input)    --> Image height (max 480)
