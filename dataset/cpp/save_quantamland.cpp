/**
 * In Quantumland, there are n cities numbered from 1 to n. Here, ci denotes the ith city.
 * There are nâˆ’1 roads in Quantumland. Here, ci and ci+1 have a bidirectional road between them for each i<n.
 * There is a rumor that Flatland is going to attack Quantumland, and the queen wants to keep her land safe.
 * The road between ci and ci+1 is safe if there is a guard in ci or ci+1.
 * The queen has already placed a few guards in some of the cities,
 * but she is not sure if they are enough to keep the roads safe.
 * She wants to know the minimum number of new guards she needs to hire.
 *
 * Input format:
 * The first line will contain an integer n.
 * In the next line, there will be n integers b1,b2...bn.
 *
 * If bi=1, that means there is a guard in city ci.
 * If bi=0, that means there are no guards in city ci.
 *
 * Example input
 * 5
 * 1 1 0 1 0
 * 5
 * 0 0 1 0 0
 *
 * Output:
 * 0
 * 2
 *
