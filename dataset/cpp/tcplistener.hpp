/**
@class EE::Network::TcpListener

A listener socket is a special type of socket that listens to
a given port and waits for connections on that port.
This is all it can do.

When a new connection is received, you must call accept and
the listener returns a new instance of TcpSocket that
is properly initialized and can be used to communicate with
the new client.

Listener sockets are specific to the TCP protocol,
UDP sockets are connectionless and can therefore communicate
directly. As a consequence, a listener socket will always
return the new connections as TcpSocket instances.

A listener is automatically closed on destruction, like all
other types of socket. However if you want to stop listening
before the socket is destroyed, you can call its close()
function.

Usage example:
@code
// Create a listener socket and make it wait for new
// connections on port 55001
TcpListener listener;
listener.listen(55001);

// Endless loop that waits for new connections
while (running) {
	 TcpSocket client;
	 if (listener.accept(client) == Socket::Done) {
		 // A new client just connected!
		 std::cout << "New connection received from " << client.getRemoteAddress() << std::endl;
		 doSomethingWith(client);
	 }
}
