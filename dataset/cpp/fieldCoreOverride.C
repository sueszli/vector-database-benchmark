//      1) The FCO number is relative to Fused Core mode. In Fused Core mode FCO number refers to FC, in Small Core mode
//         FCO number refers to CORE
//             1a) The FCO number applies to the entire system, e.g. FCO=1 in Fused Core mode means 1 FC total, in Small
//                 Core mode that means 1 CORE total.
//             1b) FCO=0 is a special value that indicates no Field Core Overrides.
//      2) COREs should be spread across all PROCs as evenly as possible.
//             2a) Must always keep the CORE/FC that the SBE booted Hostboot with.
//             2b) FCO only considers functional cores
//             2c) FCO does not include ECO cores, only active execution cores.
//             2d) Cores must be deconfigured in the order that the chip team provides.
//      3) In Fused Core mode, algorithm cannot break apart an FC.
//      4) The FCO number is the maximum number of CORE/FCs to use in the system. So, if the number of available units
//         is less than that then that's acceptable but should get as close as possible.
//      5) FCO should never deconfigure a PROC. A PROC with no cores can actually be desirable in some scenarios.
//
// To follow these rules, the algorithm in this function is as follows:
//    * Scale the FCO number in terms of number of COREs to remain, based on system type. This algorithm operates on
//      CORE level granulaity to follow chip team deconfigure priorities.
//    * Determine the ideal remaining units per PROC to keep. Ideally, following Rule 2 would result in a simple
//      calculation of RemainingUnits = FCO / NumberOfProcs but that's not always going to be possible. The
//      implementation of that calculation will go into more detail but broadly speaking the ideal amount will be
//      as large as possible.
//    * Given the ideal remaining units per proc, iterate over each proc and deconfigure COREs by priority until the
//      remaining available cores for the proc is less than or equal to the maximum value that proc can leave
//      functional. That max value is decided on per proc and is influenced by the ideal value.
//    * The sum of the remaining available cores between all procs is now less than or equal to the given FCO number.

        // would require violating Rule 3 to satisfy Rule 2. So, to not violate Rule 3, a PROC can "borrow" a CORE from
        // the next PROC in the list. Hence the need to keep track of the "debt" incurred from a prior PROC.
        // A simple example: FCO=28(14 FCs), Number of PROCs=4, so ideal number is 7. In Fused Core mode that value
