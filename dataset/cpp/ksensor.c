 * Kernel Sensor Framework
 *
 * The kernel sensor framework exists to provide a simple and straightforward
 * means for various parts of the system to declare and instantiate sensor
 * information. Between this and the ksensor character device
 * (uts/common/io/ksensor/ksensor_drv.c) this exposes per-device sensors and
 * character devices.
 *
 * --------------------------
 * Driver and User Interfaces
 * --------------------------
 *
 * Each sensor that is registered with the framework is exposed as a character
 * device under /dev/sensors. The device class and node name are often ':'
 * delineated and must begin with 'ddi_sensor'. Everything after 'ddi_sensor'
 * will be created in a directory under /dev/sensors. So for example the Intel
 * PCH driver uses a class "ddi_sensor:temperature:pch" and a node name of
 * 'ts.%d'. This creates the node /dev/sensors/temperature/pch/ts.0. The
 * devfsadm plugin automatically handles the creation of directories which makes
 * the addition of additional sensor types easy to create.
 *
 * Strictly speaking, any device can manage their own sensors and minor nodes by
 * using the appropriate class and implementing the corresponding ioctls. That
 * was how the first kernel sensors were written; however, there are a lot of
 * issues with that which led to this:
 *
 * 1. Every driver had to actually implement character devices.
 *
 * 2. Every driver had to duplicate a lot of the logic around open(9E),
 *    close(9E), and ioctl(9E).
 *
 * 3. Drivers that tied into frameworks like mac(9E) or SCSAv3 needed a lot more
 *    work to fit into this model. For example, because the minor state is
 *    shared between all the instances and the frameworks, they would have
 *    required shared, global state that they don't have today.
 *
 * Ultimately, having an operations vector and a callback argument makes work a
 * lot simpler for the producers of sensor data and that simplicity makes it
 * worthwhile to take on additional effort and work here.
 *
 * ----------
 * Components
 * ----------
 *
 * The ksensor framework is made of a couple of different pieces:
 *
 * 1. This glue that is a part of genunix.
 * 2. The ksensor character device driver.
 * 3. Sensor providers, which are generally drivers that register with the
 *    ksensor framework.
 *
 * The implementation of (1) is all in this file. The implementation of (2) is
 * in uts/common/io/ksensor/ksensor_drv.c. The implementation of (3) is found in
 * all of the different leaf devices. Examples of (3) include pchtemp(4D) and
 * igb(4D).
 *
 * We separate numbers one and two into two different components for a few
 * reasons. The most important thing is that drivers that provide sensors should
 * not be dependent on some other part of the system having been loaded. This
 * makes a compelling argument for it being a part of the core kernel. However,
 * like other subsystems (e.g. kstats, smbios, etc.), it's useful to separate
 * out the thing that provides the interface to users with the thing that is
 * used to glue together providers in the kernel. There's the added benefit that
 * it's practically simpler to spin up a pseudo-device through a module.
 *
 * The ksensor character device driver (2) registers with the main genunix
 * ksensor code (1) when it attaches and when it detaches. The kernel only
 * allows a single driver to be attached to it. When that character device
 * driver attaches, the ksensor framework will walk through all of the currently
 * registered sensors and inform the character device driver of the nodes that
 * it needs to create. While the character device driver is attached, the
 * ksensor framework will also call back into it when a sensor needs to be
 * removed.
 *
 * Generally speaking, this distinction of responsibilities allows the kernel
 * sensor character device driver to attach and detach without impact to the
 * sensor providers or them even being notified at all, it's all transparent to
 * them.
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Sensor Lifetime and detach(9E)
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * Traditionally, a device driver may be detached by the broader kernel whenever
 * the kernel desires it. On debug builds this happens by a dedicated thread. On
 * a non-debug build this may happen due to memory pressure or as an attempt to
 * reclaim idle resources (though this is much less common). However, when the
 * module is detached, the system remembers that minor nodes previously existed
 * and that entries in /devices had been created. When something proceeds to
 * access an entry in /devices again, the system will use that to bring a driver
 * back to life. It doesn't matter whether it's a pseudo-device driver or
 * something else, this can happen.
 *
 * One downside to the sensor framework, is that we need to emulate this
 * behavior which leads to some amount of complexity here. But this is a
 * worthwhile tradeoff as it makes things much simpler for providers and it's
 * not too hard for us to emulate this behavior.
 *
 * When a sensor provider registers the sensor, the sensor becomes available to
 * the system. When the sensor provider unregisters with the system, which
 * happens during its detach routine, then we note that it has been detached;
 * however, we don't delete its minor node and if something accesses it, we
 * attempt to load the driver again, the same way that devfs (the file system
 * behind /devices) does.
 *
 * For each dev_info_t that registers a sensor we register a callback such that
 * when the device is removed, e.g. someone called rem_drv or physically pulls
 * the device, then we'll be able to finally clean up the device. This lifetime
 * can be represented in the following image:

 *   | Deleted |--<---------------+     again
 *   +---------+
 *
 * When the DDI unbind callback is called, we know that the device is going to
 * be removed. However, this happens within a subtle context with a majority of
 * the device tree held (at least the dip's parent). In particular, another
 * thread may be trying to obtain a hold on it and be blocked in
 * ndi_devi_enter(). As the callback thread holds that, that could lead to a
 * deadlock. As a result, we clean things up in two phases. One during the
 * synchronous callback and the other via a taskq. In the first phase we
 * logically do the following:
 *
 *  o Remove the dip from the list of ksensor dips and set the flag that
 *    indicates that it's been removed.
 *  o Remove all of the sensors from the global avl to make sure that new
 *    threads cannot look it up.
 *
 * Then, after the taskq is dispatched, we do the following in taskq context:
 *
 *  o Tell the ksensor driver that it should remove the minor node.
 *  o Block on each sensor until it is no-longer busy and then clean it up.
 *  o Clean up the ksensor_dip_t.
 *
 * ------------------
 * Accessing a Sensor
 * ------------------
 *
 * Access to a particular sensor is serialized in the system. In addition to
 * that, a number of steps are required to access one that is not unlike
 * accessing a character device. When a given sensor is held the KSENSOR_F_BUSY
 * flag is set in the ksensor_flags member. In addition, as part of taking a
 * hold a number of side effects occur that ensure that the sensor provider's
 * dev_info_t is considered busy and can't be detached.
 *
 * To obtain a hold on a sensor the following logical steps are required (see
 * ksensor_hold_by_id() for the implementation):
 *
 *  1. Map the minor to the ksensor_t via the avl tree
 *  2. Check that the ksensor's dip is valid
 *  3. If the sensor is busy, wait until it is no longer so, and restart from
 *     the top. Otherwise, mark the sensor as busy.
 *  4. Enter the parent and place a hold on the sensor provider's dip.
 *  5. Once again check if the dip is removed or not because we have to drop
 *     locks during that operation.
 *  6. Check if the ksensor has the valid flag set. If not, attempt to configure
 *     the dip.
 *  7. Assuming the sensor is now valid, we can return it.
 *
 * After this point, the sensor is considered valid for use. Once the consumer
 * is finished with the sensor, it should be released by calling
 * ksensor_release().
 *
 * An important aspect of the above scheme is that the KSENSOR_F_BUSY flag is
 * required to progress through the validation and holding of the device. This
 * makes sure that only one thread is attempting to attach it at a given time. A
 * reasonable future optimization would be to amortize this cost in open(9E)
 * and close(9E) of the minor and to bump a count as it being referenced as long
 * as it is open.
 *
 * -----------------------------
 * Character Device Registration
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * The 'ksensor' character device driver can come and go. To support this, the
 * ksensor framework communicates with the ksensor character device by a
 * well-defined set of callbacks, used to indicate sensor addition and removal.
 * The ksensor character device is found in uts/common/io/ksensor/ksensor_drv.c.
 * The ksensor character device is responsible for creating and destroying minor
 * nodes.
 *
 * Each ksensor_t has a flag, KSENSOR_F_NOTIFIED, that is used to indicate
 * whether or not the registered driver has been notified of the sensor. When a
 * callback is first registered, we'll walk through the entire list of nodes to
 * make sure that its minor has been created. When unregistering, the minor node
 * remove callback will not be called; however, this can generally by dealt with
 * by calling something like ddi_remove_minor_node(dip, NULL).
 *
 * -------
 * Locking
 * -------
 *
 * The following rules apply to dealing with lock ordering:
 *
 * 1. The global ksensor_g_mutex protects all global data and must be taken
 *    before a ksensor_t's individual mutex.
 *
 * 2. A thread should not hold any two ksensor_t's mutex at any time.
 *
 * 3. No locks should be held when attempting to grab or manipulate a
 *    dev_info_t, e.g. ndi_devi_enter().
 *
 * 4. Unless the ksensor is actively being held, whenever a ksensor is found,
 *    one must check whether the ksensor_dip_t flag KSENSOR_DIP_F_REMOVED is
 *    set or not and whether the ksensor_t's KSENSOR_F_VALID flag is set.
