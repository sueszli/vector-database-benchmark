### <summary>
### This regression algorithm tests Out of The Money (OTM) index option expiry for calls.
### We expect 2 orders from the algorithm, which are:
###
###   * Initial entry, buy SPX Call Option (expiring OTM)
###     - contract expires worthless, not exercised, so never opened a position in the underlying
###
###   * Liquidation of worthless SPX call option (expiring OTM)
###
### Additionally, we test delistings for index options and assert that our
### portfolio holdings reflect the orders the algorithm has submitted.
### </summary>
### <remarks>
### Total Trades in regression algorithm should be 1, but expiration is counted as a trade.
### See related issue: https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/4854
