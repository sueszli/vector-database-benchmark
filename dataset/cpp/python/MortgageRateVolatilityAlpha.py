    This Alpha Model uses Wells Fargo 30-year Fixed Rate Mortgage data from Quandl to 
    generate Insights about the movement of Real Estate ETFs. Mortgage rates can provide information 
    regarding the general price trend of real estate, and ETFs provide good continuous-time instruments 
    to measure the impact against. Volatility in mortgage rates tends to put downward pressure on real 
    estate prices, whereas stable mortgage rates, regardless of true rate, lead to stable or higher real
    estate prices. This Alpha model seeks to take advantage of this correlation by emitting insights
    based on volatility and rate deviation from its historic mean.

    This alpha is part of the Benchmark Alpha Series created by QuantConnect which are open
    sourced so the community and client funds can see an example of an alpha.
