    Examples

        from turicreate.util import gl_pickle

        pickler.dump(obj)

        # The pickler has to be closed to make sure the files get closed.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        unpickler = gl_pickle.GLUnpickler(filename = 'foo-bar')
        obj = unpickler.load()
        unpickler.close()
        print obj

    The GLC pickler needs a temporary working directory to manage GLC objects.
    This temporary working path must be a local path to the file system. It
    can also be a relative path in the FS.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        unpickler = gl_pickle.GLUnpickler('foo-bar')
        obj = unpickler.load()
        unpickler.close()
        print obj


    Notes
    --------

    The GLC pickler saves the files into single zip archive with the following
    file layout.

    pickle_file_name: Name of the file in the archive that contains
                      the name of the pickle file.
                      The comment in the ZipFile contains the version number
                      of the GLC pickler used.

    "pickle_file": The pickle file that stores all python objects. For GLC objects
                   the pickle file contains a tuple with (ClassName, relative_path)
                   which stores the name of the GLC object type and a relative
                   path (in the zip archive) which points to the GLC archive
                   root directory.

    "gl_archive_dir_1" : A directory which is the GLC archive for a single
                          object.

        Notes
        -----

        Borrowed from pickle docs (https://docs.python.org/2/library/_pickle.html)

        For the benefit of object persistence, the pickle module supports the
        notion of a reference to an object outside the pickled data stream.

        To pickle objects that have an external persistent id, the pickler must
        have a custom persistent_id() method that takes an object as an argument and
        returns either None or the persistent id for that object.

        For GLC objects, the persistent_id is merely a relative file path (within
        the ZIP archive) to the GLC archive where the GLC object is saved. For
        example:

            (SFrame, 'sframe-save-path')
