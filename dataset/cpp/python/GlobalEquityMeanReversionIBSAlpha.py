# Equity indices exhibit mean reversion in daily returns. The Internal Bar Strength indicator (IBS),
# which relates the closing price of a security to its daily range can be used to identify overbought
# and oversold securities.
#
# This alpha ranks 33 global equity ETFs on its IBS value the previous day and predicts for the following day
# that the ETF with the highest IBS value will decrease in price, and the ETF with the lowest IBS value
# will increase in price.
