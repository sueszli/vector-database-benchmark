Our product is technical so our resulting documentation includes a lot of code-based examples. Before nbdev, we had no way of maintaining our code examples and ensuring that it was up-to-date for both command inputs and outputs. It was all manual. With nbdev, we now have this under control in a sustainable way. Since we’ve deployed these docs, we also had a situation where we were able to identify a bug in one of our interfaces, which we found by seeing the error that was output in the documentation.'),
    ('hugo-bowne-anderson.jpeg', 'Hugo Bowne-Anderson', 'Head of Developer Relations, Outerbounds', 'Nbdev has transformed the way we write documentation. Gone are the days of worrying about broken code examples when our API changes or due to human errors associated with copying & pasting code into markdown files. The authoring experience of nbdev is also powerful, allowing us to write prose and live code in a unified interface, which allows more experimentation with technical content. On top of this,  nbdev allows us to include unit tests in our documentation which mitigates the burden of maintaining the docs over time.')
