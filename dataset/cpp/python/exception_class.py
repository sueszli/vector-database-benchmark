"""
Exception classes are used to indicate that something has gone wrong with
the program at runtime. Functions use the `raise` keyword, if an error is
anticipated, and specify the exception class they intend to throw. This
module defines a handful of custom exception classes and shows how they
can be used in the context of a function.
"""


class CustomError(Exception):
    """Custom class of errors.

    This is a custom exception for any issues that arise in this module.
    One of the reasons why developers design a class like this is for
    consumption by downstream services and command-line tools.

    If we designed a standalone application with no downstream consumers, then
    it makes little sense to define a custom hierarchy of exceptions. In that
    case, we should use the existing hierarchy of builtin exception
    classes which are listed in the Python docs:

    https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html
    """


class DivisionError(CustomError):
    """Any division error that results from invalid input.

    This exception can be subclassed with the following exceptions if they
    happen enough across the codebase:

    - ZeroDivisorError
    - NegativeDividendError
    - NegativeDivisorError

    That being said, there's a point of diminishing returns when we design
    too many exceptions. It is better to design few exceptions that many
    developers handle than design many exceptions that few developers handle.
