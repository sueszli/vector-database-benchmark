# In a perfect market, you could buy 100 EUR worth of USD, sell 100 EUR worth of GBP,
# and then use the GBP to buy USD and wind up with the same amount in USD as you received when
# you bought them with EUR. This relationship is expressed by the Triangle Exchange Rate, which is
#
#     Triangle Exchange Rate = (A/B) * (B/C) * (C/A)
#
# where (A/B) is the exchange rate of A-to-B. In a perfect market, TER = 1, and so when
# there is a mispricing in the market, then TER will not be 1 and there exists an arbitrage opportunity.
#
# This alpha is part of the Benchmark Alpha Series created by QuantConnect which are open sourced so the community and client funds can see an example of an alpha.
