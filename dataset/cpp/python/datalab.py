class Datalab:
    """
    A single object to automatically detect all kinds of issues in datasets.
    This is how we recommend you interface with the cleanlab library if you want to audit the quality of your data and detect issues within it.
    If you have other specific goals (or are doing a less standard ML task not supported by Datalab), then consider using the other methods across the library.
    Datalab tracks intermediate state (e.g. data statistics) from certain cleanlab functions that can be re-used across other cleanlab functions for better efficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Union[Dataset, pd.DataFrame, dict, list, str]
        Dataset-like object that can be converted to a Hugging Face Dataset object.

        It should contain the labels for all examples, identified by a
        `label_name` column in the Dataset object.

        Supported formats:
          - datasets.Dataset
          - pandas.DataFrame
          - dict (keys are strings, values are arrays/lists of length ``N``)
          - list (list of dictionaries that each have the same keys)
          - str

            - path to a local file: Text (.txt), CSV (.csv), JSON (.json)
            - or a dataset identifier on the Hugging Face Hub

    label_name : str, optional
        The name of the label column in the dataset.

    image_key : str, optional
        Optional key that can be specified for image datasets to point to the field containing the actual images themselves.
        If specified, additional image-specific issue types can be detected in the dataset.
        See the CleanVision package `documentation <https://cleanvision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for descriptions of these image-specific issue types.

    verbosity : int, optional
        The higher the verbosity level, the more information
        Datalab prints when auditing a dataset.
        Valid values are 0 through 4. Default is 1.

    Examples

        Checks the dataset for all sorts of common issues in real-world data (in both labels and feature values).

        You can use Datalab to find issues in your data, utilizing *any* model you have already trained.
        This method only interacts with your model via its predictions or embeddings (and other functions thereof).
        The more of these inputs you provide, the more types of issues Datalab can detect in your dataset/labels.
        If you provide a subset of these inputs, Datalab will output what insights it can based on the limited information from your model.

        Note
        ----
        This method acts as a wrapper around the :py:meth:`IssueFinder.find_issues <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_finder.IssueFinder.find_issues>` method,
        where the core logic for issue detection is implemented.

        Note
        ----
        The issues are saved in the ``self.issues`` attribute, but are not returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pred_probs :
            Out-of-sample predicted class probabilities made by the model for every example in the dataset.
            To best detect label issues, provide this input obtained from the most accurate model you can produce.

            If provided, this must be a 2D array with shape (num_examples, K) where K is the number of classes in the dataset.

        features : Optional[np.ndarray]
            Feature embeddings (vector representations) of every example in the dataset.

            If provided, this must be a 2D array with shape (num_examples, num_features).

        knn_graph :
            Sparse matrix representing distances between examples in the dataset in a k nearest neighbor graph.

            If provided, this must be a square CSR matrix with shape (num_examples, num_examples) and (k*num_examples) non-zero entries (k is the number of nearest neighbors considered for each example)
            evenly distributed across the rows.
            The non-zero entries must be the distances between the corresponding examples. Self-distances must be omitted
            (i.e. the diagonal must be all zeros and the k nearest neighbors of each example must not include itself).

            For any duplicated examples i,j whose distance is 0, there should be an *explicit* zero stored in the matrix, i.e. ``knn_graph[i,j] = 0``.

            If both `knn_graph` and `features` are provided, the `knn_graph` will take precendence.
            If `knn_graph` is not provided, it is constructed based on the provided `features`.
            If neither `knn_graph` nor `features` are provided, certain issue types like (near) duplicates will not be considered.

        issue_types :
            Collection specifying which types of issues to consider in audit and any non-default parameter settings to use.
            If unspecified, a default set of issue types and recommended parameter settings is considered.

            This is a dictionary of dictionaries, where the keys are the issue types of interest
            and the values are dictionaries of parameter values that control how each type of issue is detected (only for advanced users).
            More specifically, the values are constructor keyword arguments passed to the corresponding ``IssueManager``,
            which is responsible for detecting the particular issue type.

            .. seealso::
                :py:class:`IssueManager <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_manager.issue_manager.IssueManager>`

        Examples
        --------

        Here are some ways to provide inputs to :py:meth:`find_issues`:

        - Passing ``pred_probs``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
                >>> pred_probs = clf.predict_proba(X)
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs)


        - Passing ``features``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
                >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(features=X)

        .. note::

            You can pass both ``pred_probs`` and ``features`` to :py:meth:`find_issues` for a more comprehensive audit.

        - Passing a ``knn_graph``:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from cleanlab import Datalab
                >>> X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0]])
                >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])
                >>> nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric="euclidean").fit(X)
                >>> knn_graph = nbrs.kneighbors_graph(mode="distance")
                >>> knn_graph # Pass this to Datalab
                <4x4 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
                        with 8 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
                >>> knn_graph.toarray()  # DO NOT PASS knn_graph.toarray() to Datalab, only pass the sparse matrix itself
                array([[0.        , 1.        , 2.23606798, 0.        ],
                        [1.        , 0.        , 1.41421356, 0.        ],
                        [0.        , 1.41421356, 0.        , 2.        ],
                        [0.        , 1.41421356, 2.        , 0.        ]])
                >>> lab = Datalab(data={"X": X, "y": y}, label_name="y")
                >>> lab.find_issues(knn_graph=knn_graph)

        - Configuring issue types:
            Suppose you want to only consider label issues. Just pass a dictionary with the key "label" and an empty dictionary as the value (to use default label issue parameters).

            .. code-block:: python

                >>> issue_types = {"label": {}}
                >>> # lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs, issue_types=issue_types)

            If you are advanced user who wants greater control, you can pass keyword arguments to the issue manager that handles the label issues.
            For example, if you want to pass the keyword argument "clean_learning_kwargs"
            to the constructor of the :py:class:`LabelIssueManager <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_manager.label.LabelIssueManager>`, you would pass:


            .. code-block:: python

                >>> issue_types = {
                ...     "label": {
                ...         "clean_learning_kwargs": {
                ...             "prune_method": "prune_by_noise_rate",
                ...         },
                ...     },
                ... }
                >>> # lab.find_issues(pred_probs=pred_probs, issue_types=issue_types)
