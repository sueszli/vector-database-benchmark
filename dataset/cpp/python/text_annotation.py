A text annotation represents a “sticky note” attached to a point in the PDF document. When closed, the
annotation shall appear as an icon; when open, it shall display a pop-up window containing the text of the note
in a font and size chosen by the conforming reader. Text annotations shall not scale and rotate with the page;
they shall behave as if the NoZoom and NoRotate annotation flags (see Table 165) were always set. Table 172
