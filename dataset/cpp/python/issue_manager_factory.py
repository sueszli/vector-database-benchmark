"""The factory module provides a factory class for constructing concrete issue managers
and a decorator for registering new issue managers.

This module provides the :py:meth:`register` decorator for users to register new subclasses of
:py:class:`IssueManager <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_manager.issue_manager.IssueManager>`
in the registry. Each IssueManager detects some particular type of issue in a dataset.


Note
----

The :class:`REGISTRY` variable is used by the factory class to keep track
of registered issue managers.
The factory class is used as an implementation detail by
:py:class:`Datalab <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab>`,
which provides a simplified API for constructing concrete issue managers.
:py:class:`Datalab <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab>` is intended to be used by users
and provides detailed documentation on how to use the API.

Warning
-------
Neither the :class:`REGISTRY` variable nor the factory class should be used directly by users.
