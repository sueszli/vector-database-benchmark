"""
Metaclass are used to modify a class as it is being created at runtime.
This module shows how a metaclass can add database attributes and tables
to "logic-free" model classes for the developer.

from abc import ABC


class ModelMeta(type):
    """Model metaclass.

    By studying how SQLAlchemy and Django ORM work under the hood, we can see
    a metaclass can add useful abstractions to class definitions at runtime.
    That being said, this metaclass is a toy example and does not reflect
    everything that happens in either framework. Check out the source code
    in SQLAlchemy and Django to see what actually happens:

    https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy
    https://github.com/django/django

    The main use cases for a metaclass are (A) to modify a class before
    it is visible to a developer and (B) to add a class to a dynamic registry
    for further automation.

    Do NOT use a metaclass if a task can be done more simply with class
    composition, class inheritance or functions. Simple code is the reason
    why Python is attractive for 99% of users.
