    # Multi-instance Training
    #
    # It is often beneficial to use multiple instances
    # for training if a server contains multiple sockets or
    # many cores, so that the workload can make full use of
    # all CPU cores.
    #
    # When using data-parallel training, the batch size is equivalent to
    # becoming n times larger, where n is the number of parallel processes.
    # We should to scale the learning rate to n times as well to achieve the
    # same effect as single instance training.
    # However, scaling the learning rate linearly may lead to poor convergence
    # at the beginning of training, so we should gradually increase the
    # learning rate to n times, and this is called 'learning rate warmup'.
    # 
    # Fortunately, BigDL-Nano makes it very easy to conduct multi-instance 
    # training correctly. It will handle all these for you.
    #
    # In BigDL-Nano, you can simply set the num_processes in
    # TorchNano to enable multi-instance training. In addition, it will automatically
    # apply learning rate scaling and warmup for your training.
    #
