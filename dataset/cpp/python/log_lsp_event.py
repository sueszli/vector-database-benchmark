This module provides shared logic for logging events - mainly
error information - in Pyre language servers (whenever telemetry is
enabled, which it is not by default in open-source Pyre).

Be default these logs go to the table pyre_lsp_events.

Note that this Pyre-side logging is distinct from editor-handled language
server telemetry, which (when enabled) is accomplished by sending special
json messages to the editor, which is responsible for loggign them.
