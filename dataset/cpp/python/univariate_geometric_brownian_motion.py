  """Geometric Brownian Motion.

  Represents the 1-dimensional Ito process:

  ```None
    dX(t) = means(t) * X(t) * dt + volatilities(t) * X(t) * dW(t),

  where `W(t)` is a 1D Brownian motion, `mean(t)` and `volatility(t)` are either
  constant `Tensor`s or piecewise constant functions of time.

  Supports batching which enables modelling multiple univariate geometric
  brownian motions (GBMs) efficiently. No guarantee is made about the
  relationships between the batched univariate GMBs. To control the correlation
  between multiple GBMs use `MultivariateGeometricBrownianMotion`.

    """Returns a solver for Feynman-Kac PDE associated to the process.

    This method applies a finite difference method to solve the final value
    problem as it appears in the Feynman-Kac formula associated to this Ito
    process. The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov
    equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion
    of a discounting function.

    For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this
    method is:

    ```None
      dV(t)/dt + mean(t, x) dV_i/dx
      + (1/2) volatility^2(t, x) d^2V_i/dx^2 - r(t, x) V = 0
    ```
    This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
    time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).
    The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on a grid.

    This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
    the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
    (e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously corresponding to `mean_1, mean_2 ...` and
    `volatility_1, volatility_2 ....`.

    The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
    discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
    the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
    (sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
    time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time
    step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
    steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
    `time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
    discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
    may not be applicable to some implementations.

    The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
    methods, see functions in `math.pde.steppers` module.

    The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
    equation are described in the Args section below.

    For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see
    `models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_backward`.

    Args:
      start_time: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.
        Corresponds to time `t0` above.
      end_time: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater
        than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.
      coord_grid: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the
        domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of
        the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds
        to the spatial grid `G` above.
      values_grid: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
        `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
        of the `Tensor` must broadcast with `[K, d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. The first
        axis of size `K` is the values batch dimension and allows multiple
        functions (with potentially different boundary/final conditions) to be
        stepped back simultaneously.
      discounting: Callable corresponding to `r(t,x)` above. If not supplied,
        zero discounting is assumed.
      one_step_fn: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
        arguments by keyword:
          1. 'time': Current time
          2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
            evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
          3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.
          4. 'values_grid': The values grid.
          5. 'boundary_conditions': The boundary conditions.
          6. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients
            of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts
            the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a
            `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.
          7. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the
            PDE (i.e. `mean_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as
            keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts
            with `[dim]`.
          8. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the
            linear homogeneous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.
            The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next
            coordinate grid, next values grid.
      boundary_conditions: A list of size `dim` containing boundary conditions.
        The i'th element of the list is a 2-tuple containing the lower and upper
        boundary condition for the boundary along the i`th axis.
      start_step_count: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of
        time steps performed.
        Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
      num_steps: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
        when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the
        `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is
        `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the
        solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
        above.
      time_step: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`

          `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
          maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
          the total number of steps taken is N = (t0 - t1) / dt rounded up to
          the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
          step is of size `t0 - t1 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
          current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
          the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
      values_transform_fn: An optional callable applied to transform the
        solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the
        time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the
        grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the
        values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
      dtype: The dtype to use.
      name: The name to give to the ops.
        Default value: None which means `solve_backward` is used.

          arguments by name and returns the same tuple object as required below.
          Defaults to `tff.math.pde.fd_solvers.solve_backward`.

    Returns:
      A tuple object containing at least the following attributes:
        final_values_grid: A `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `values_grid`.
          Contains the final state of the values grid at time `end_time`.
        final_coord_grid: A list of `Tensor`s of the same specification as
          the input `coord_grid`. Final state of the coordinate grid at time
          `end_time`.
        step_count: The total step count (i.e. the sum of the `start_step_count`
          and the number of steps performed in this call.).
        final_time: The final time at which the evolution stopped. This value
          is given by `max(min(end_time, start_time), 0)`.

    r"""Returns a solver for the Fokker Plank equation of this process.

    The Fokker Plank equation (also known as the Kolmogorov Forward equation)
    associated to this Ito process is given by:

    ```None
      dV/dt + d(mean_i(t, x) V) / dx
        - (1/2) d^2(volatility^2(t, x) V) / dx^2 =  = 0
    ```

    with the initial value condition $$V(0, x) = u(x)$$.

    This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
    time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).
    The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on a grid.

    This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
    the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
    (e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously corresponding to `mean_1, mean_2 ...` and
    `volatility_1, volatility_2 ....`.

    The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
    discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
    the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
    (sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
    time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time
    step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
    steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
    `time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
    discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
    may not be applicable to some implementations.

    The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
    methods, see functions in `math.pde.steppers` module.

    The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
    equation are described in the Args section below.

    For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see
    `models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_forward`.

    Args:
      start_time: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.
        Corresponds to time `t0` above.
      end_time: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater
        than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.
      coord_grid: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the
        domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of
        the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds
        to the spatial grid `G` above.
      values_grid: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
        `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
        of the `Tensor` must broadcast with `[K, d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. The first
        axis of size `K` is the values batch dimension and allows multiple
        functions (with potentially different boundary/final conditions) to be
        stepped back simultaneously.
      one_step_fn: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
        arguments by keyword:
          1. 'time': Current time
          2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
            evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
          3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.
          4. 'values_grid': The values grid.
          5. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients
            of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts
            the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a
            `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.
          6. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the
            PDE (i.e. `mean_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as
            keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts
            with `[dim]`.
          7. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the
            linear homogeneous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.
            The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next
            coordinate grid, next values grid.
      boundary_conditions: A list of size `dim` containing boundary conditions.
        The i'th element of the list is a 2-tuple containing the lower and upper
        boundary condition for the boundary along the i`th axis.
      start_step_count: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of
        time steps performed.
        Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
      num_steps: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
        when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the
        `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is
        `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the
        solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
        above.
      time_step: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`
        argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may
        be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case
          `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
          maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
          the total number of steps taken is N = (t1 - t0) / dt rounded up to
          the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
          step is of size `t1 - t0 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
          current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
          the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
      values_transform_fn: An optional callable applied to transform the
        solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the
        time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the
        grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the
        values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
      dtype: The dtype to use.
      name: The name to give to the ops.
        Default value: None which means `solve_forward` is used.
      **kwargs: Additional keyword args:
        (1) pde_solver_fn: Function to solve the PDE that accepts all the above
          arguments by name and returns the same tuple object as required below.
          Defaults to `tff.math.pde.fd_solvers.solve_forward`.

    Returns:
      A tuple object containing at least the following attributes:
        final_values_grid: A `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `values_grid`.
          Contains the final state of the values grid at time `end_time`.
        final_coord_grid: A list of `Tensor`s of the same specification as
          the input `coord_grid`. Final state of the coordinate grid at time
          `end_time`.
        step_count: The total step count (i.e. the sum of the `start_step_count`
          and the number of steps performed in this call.).
        final_time: The final time at which the evolution stopped. This value
          is given by `max(min(end_time, start_time), 0)`.
