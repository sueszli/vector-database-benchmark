class ADWIN(DriftDetector):
    r"""Adaptive Windowing method for concept drift detection[^1].

    ADWIN (ADaptive WINdowing) is a popular drift detection method with mathematical guarantees.
    ADWIN efficiently keeps a variable-length window of recent items; such that it holds that
    there has no been change in the data distribution. This window is further divided into two
    sub-windows $(W_0, W_1)$ used to determine if a change has happened. ADWIN compares the average of
    $W_0$ and $W_1$ to confirm that they correspond to the same distribution. Concept drift is detected
    if the distribution equality no longer holds. Upon detecting a drift, $W_0$ is replaced by $W_1$ and a
    new $W_1$ is initialized. ADWIN uses a significance value $\delta=\in(0,1)$ to determine
    if the two sub-windows correspond to the same distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta
        Significance value.
    clock
        How often ADWIN should check for changes. 1 means every new data point, default is 32.
        Higher values speed up processing, but may also lead to increased delay in change
        detection.
    max_buckets
        The maximum number of buckets of each size that ADWIN should keep before merging buckets.
        The idea of data buckets comes from the compression algorithm introduced in the ADWIN2,
        the second iteration of the ADWIN algorithm presented in the original research paper.
        This is the ADWIN version available in River.
    min_window_length
        The minimum length allowed for a subwindow when checking for concept drift. Subwindows whose size
        is smaller than this value will be ignored during concept drift evaluation. Lower values may
        decrease delay in change detection but may also lead to more false positives.
    grace_period
        ADWIN does not perform any change detection until at least this many data points have
        arrived.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import random
    >>> from river import drift

    >>> rng = random.Random(12345)
    >>> adwin = drift.ADWIN()

    >>> # Simulate a data stream composed by two data distributions
    >>> data_stream = rng.choices([0, 1], k=1000) + rng.choices(range(4, 8), k=1000)

    >>> # Update drift detector and verify if change is detected
    >>> for i, val in enumerate(data_stream):
    ...     _ = adwin.update(val)
    ...     if adwin.drift_detected:
    ...         print(f"Change detected at index {i}, input value: {val}")
    Change detected at index 1023, input value: 4
