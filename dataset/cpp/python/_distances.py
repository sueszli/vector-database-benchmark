      be used to compute nearest neighbors based on this distance.

    Compute the Levenshtein distance between between strings. The

def dot_product(x, y):

        The 'dot_product' distance is deprecated and will be removed in future

        distance instead, although note that this is more than a name change; it
        is a *different* transformation of the dot product of two vectors.
        Please see the distances module documentation for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : dict or list
        First input vector.

    y : dict or list
        Second input vector.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float

    Notes
    -----
    - If the input vectors are in dictionary form, keys missing in one
      of the two dictionaries are assumed to have value 0.

    - Dot product distance is not a metric. This means the ball tree

    Compute the "transformed_dot_product" distance between two dictionaries or

    Notes
    -----
    - If the input vectors are in dictionary form, keys missing in one
      of the two dictionaries are assumed to have value 0.

    - Transformed dot product distance is not a metric because the distance from
      a point to itself is not 0. This means the ball tree cannot be used to
      compute nearest neighbors based on this distance.
