class EurodollarFutures:
  """Represents a collection of Eurodollar futures contracts.

  Interest rate futures are exchange traded futures contracts on Libor rates
  liquidly traded on exchanges such as Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or
  London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE). Contracts
  on CME on a US Dollar spot Libor rate are called Eurodollar (ED) Futures.
  An ED future contract at maturity T settles at the price
  100 * (1 - F(T, T1, T2))
  where F(T, T1, T2) is the spot Libor rate at time T with start T1 and
  maturity T2 (ref [1]).

  The EurodollarFutures class can used to create and price multiple contracts
  simultaneously. However all contracts within an object must be priced using a
  common reference curve.

  #### Example:
  The following example illustrates the construction of an ED future instrument
  and calculating its price.

  ```python

  import numpy as np
  import tensorflow as tf
  import tf_quant_finance as tff

  dates = tff.datetime
  instruments = tff.experimental.instruments

  dtype = np.float64
  notional = 1.
  expiry_date = dates.convert_to_date_tensor([(2021, 2, 8)])
  valuation_date = dates.convert_to_date_tensor([(2020, 2, 8)])
  rate_term = dates.periods.months(3)

  edfuture = instruments.EurodollarFutures(
      expiry_date, notional, rate_term=rate_term, dtype=dtype)

  curve_dates = valuation_date + dates.periods.months([1, 2, 3, 12, 24, 60])
  reference_curve = instruments.RateCurve(
      curve_dates,
      np.array([0.02, 0.025, 0.0275, 0.03, 0.035, 0.0325], dtype=dtype),
      dtype=dtype)

  market = instruments.InterestRateMarket(reference_curve=reference_curve,
                                          discount_curve=None)

  price = self.evaluate(edfuture.price(valuation_date, market))

        to the day count convention for the underlying rate for each contract.
        Daycount is assumed to be the same for all contracts in a given batch.
        Default value: None in which case each the day count convention of

        tenor) of the rate that determines the settlement of each contract.
        Default value: `None` in which case the the rate is assumed to be for
        the period [expiry_date, maturity_date].
      maturity_date: An optional Rank 1 `DateTensor` specifying the maturity of
        the underlying forward rate for each contract. This input should be
        specified if the input `rate_term` is `None`. If both `maturity_date`
