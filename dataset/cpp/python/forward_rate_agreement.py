class ForwardRateAgreement:
  """Represents a batch of Forward Rate Agreements (FRA).

  An FRA is a contract for the period [T, T+tau] where the holder exchanges a
  fixed rate (agreed at the start of the contract) against a floating payment
  determined at time T based on the spot Libor rate for term `tau`. The
  cashflows are exchanged at the settlement time T_s, which is either equal to T
  or close to T. The FRA are structured so that the payments are made in T+tau
  dollars (ref [1]).

  The ForwardRateAgreement class can be used to create and price multiple FRAs
  simultaneously. However all FRAs within a FRA object must be priced using
  a common reference and discount curve.

  #### Example:
  The following example illustrates the construction of a FRA instrument and
  calculating its price.

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import tensorflow as tf
  import tf_quant_finance as tff
  dates = tff.datetime

  dtype = np.float64
  notional = 1.
  settlement_date = dates.convert_to_date_tensor([(2021, 2, 8)])
  fixing_date = dates.convert_to_date_tensor([(2021, 2, 8)])
  valuation_date = dates.convert_to_date_tensor([(2020, 2, 8)])
  fixed_rate = 0.02
  rate_term = rate_term = dates.periods.months(3)

  fra = tff.experimental.instruments.ForwardRateAgreement(
        notional, settlement_date, fixing_date, fixed_rate,
        rate_term=rate_term, dtype=dtype)
  curve_dates = valuation_date + dates.periods.months([1, 2, 3, 12, 24, 60])
  reference_curve = tff.experimental.instruments.RateCurve(
      curve_dates,
      np.array([0.02, 0.025, 0.0275, 0.03, 0.035, 0.0325], dtype=dtype),
      dtype=dtype)
  market = tff.experimental.instruments.InterestRateMarket(
      reference_curve=reference_curve, discount_curve=reference_curve)

  price = fra.price(valuation_date, market)
  # Expected result: 0.00378275
  ```

      fixed_rate: A rank 1 `Tensor` of real dtype specifying the fixed rate
        payment agreed at the initiation of the individual contracts. The shape
        should be the same as that of `settlement_date`.
      notional: A scalar or a rank 1 `Tensor` of real dtype specifying the
        notional amount for each contract. When the notional is specified as a
        scalar, it is assumed that all contracts have the same notional. If the
        notional is in the form of a `Tensor`, then the shape must be the same
        as `settlement_date`.
        Default value: 1.0
      daycount_convention: An optional `DayCountConvention` to determine
        how cashflows are accrued for each contract. Daycount is assumed to be
        the same for all contracts in a given batch.
        Default value: None in which case the daycount convention will default
        to DayCountConvention.ACTUAL_360 for all contracts.
      rate_term: An optional rank 1 `PeriodTensor` specifying the term (or the
        tenor) of the Libor rate that determines the floating cashflow. The
        shape of the input should be the same as `settlement_date`.
        Default value: `None` in which case the the forward rate is determined
        for the period [settlement_date, maturity_date].
      maturity_date: An optional rank 1 `DateTensor` specifying the maturity of
        the underlying forward rate for each contract. This input is only used
        if the input `rate_term` is `None`.
        Default value: `None`
      dtype: `tf.Dtype`. If supplied the dtype for the real variables or ops
