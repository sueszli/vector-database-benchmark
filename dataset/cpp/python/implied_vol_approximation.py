  """Approximates the implied vol using the Stefanica-Radiocic algorithm.

  Finds an approximation to the implied vol using the Polya approximation for
  the Normal CDF. This algorithm was described by Stefanica and Radiocic in
  ref [1]. They show that if the Normal CDFs appearing in the Black Scholes
  formula for the option price are replaced with Polya's approximation, the
  implied vol can be solved for analytically. The Polya approximation produces
  absolute errors of less than 0.003 and the resulting implied vol is fairly
  close to the true value. For practical purposes, this may not be accurate
  enough so this result should be used as a starting point for some method with
  controllable tolerance (e.g. a root finder).

  Args:
    prices: A real `Tensor` of any shape. The prices of the options whose
      implied vol is to be calculated.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype as `prices` and a shape that
      broadcasts with `prices`. The strikes of the options.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype as `prices` and a shape that
      broadcasts with `prices`. The expiry for each option. The units should
      be such that `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape
      of the `prices`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `prices`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the `spots`
      must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the `prices`.
      If not None, these are the discount factors to expiry (i.e. e^(-rT)).
      If None, no discounting is applied (i.e. it is assumed that the
      undiscounted option prices are provided ). If `spots` is supplied and
      `discount_factors` is not None then this is also used to compute the
      forwards to expiry.
      Default value: None, equivalent to discount factors = 1.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with `prices`.
      Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put (if False).
      If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    validate_args: A Python bool. If True, indicates that arguments should be
      checked for correctness before performing the computation. The checks
      performed are: (1) Forwards/spots and strikes are positive. (2) The prices
        satisfy the arbitrage bounds (i.e. for call options, checks the
        inequality `max(F-K, 0) <= Price <= F` and for put options, checks that
        `max(K-F, 0) <= Price <= K`.). (3) Checks that the prices are not too
        close to the bounds. It is numerically unstable to compute the implied
        vols from options too far in the money or out of the money.
      Default value: False
    polya_factor: A real scalar. The coefficient to use in the
      approximation for the Normal CDF. The approximation is: `N(x) ~ 0.5 + 0.5
        * sign(x) * sqrt[ 1 - exp(-k * x**2) ]` where `k` is the coefficient
        supplied with `polya_factor`. The original Polya approximation has the
        value `2 / pi` and this is approximation used in Ref [1]. However, as
        described in Ref [2], a slightly more accurate approximation is achieved
        if we use the value of `k=5/8`).
    dtype: `tf.Dtype` to use when converting arguments to `Tensor`s. If not
      supplied, the default TensorFlow conversion will take place. Note that
      this argument does not do any casting for `Tensor`s or numpy arrays.
      Default value: None.
    name: (Optional) Python str. The name prefixed to the ops created by this
      function. If not supplied, the default name 'implied_vol' is
      used.
      Default value: None

  Returns:
    implied_vols: A `Tensor` of the same dtype as `prices` and shape as the
      common broadcasted shape of `(prices, spots/forwards, strikes, expiries)`.
      The approximate implied total volatilities computed using the Polya
      approximation method.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is
      supplied.

  ## Implementation Notes
  The mapping between the notation used in the reference paper and the code
  below is as follows:
    y -> log_normalized_forwards
    alpha_c -> normalized_prices
  This notation is used in the in-line comments.

  Args:
    normalized_prices: `Tensor` of real dtype and any shape. The prices of the
      options to be inverted. Normalization means that the raw price is divided
      by the strike discounted to the present.
    normalized_forwards: `Tensor` or same dtype and shape as `normalized_prices`
      The forwards divided by the strike of the options.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `normalized_forwards`.
      The expiry for each option.
    is_call_options: Boolean `Tensor` of same shape as `normalized_prices` or
      None. Indicates whether a price is for a call option (if True) or a put
      option (if False). If None is specified, it is assumed that all the
      options are call options.
    polya_factor: Scalar `Tensor` of same dtype as `normalized_prices`. This is
      the factor to use for approximating the normal CDF in a Polya-like
      expression. Polya approximation is: N(x) ~ 0.5 + sign(x) sqrt(1-e^(-k
        x^2)) with k = 2 / pi. However, it has been found that other values for
        `k` may be more accurate. The value that minimizes the absolute error
        over the range [-10, 10] is 0.62305051 (approximately 5/8).
