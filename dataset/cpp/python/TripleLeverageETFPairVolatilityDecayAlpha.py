#
# Leveraged ETFs (LETF) promise a fixed leverage ratio with respect to an underlying asset or an index.
# A Triple-Leveraged ETF allows speculators to amplify their exposure to the daily returns of an underlying index by a factor of 3.
#
# Increased volatility generally decreases the value of a LETF over an extended period of time as daily compounding is amplified.
#
# This alpha emits short-biased insight to capitalize on volatility decay for each listed pair of TL-ETFs, by rebalancing the
# ETFs with equal weights each day.
#
# This alpha is part of the Benchmark Alpha Series created by QuantConnect which are open sourced so the community and client funds can see an example of an alpha.
