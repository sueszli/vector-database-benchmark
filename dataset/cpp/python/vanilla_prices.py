  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      If not `None`, discount factors are calculated as e^(-rT),
      where r are the discount rates, or risk free rates. At most one of
      `discount_rates` and `discount_factors` can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      `discount_factors` also not given.
    dividend_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to q = 0.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not `None`, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). Mutually exclusive with `discount_rates`. If neither is
      given, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted option price is
      returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors` is not `None`
      then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry. At most one of
      `discount_rates` and `discount_factors` can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, which maps to e^(-rT) calculated from
      discount_rates.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    is_normal_volatility: An optional Python boolean specifying whether the
      `volatilities` correspond to lognormal Black volatility (if False) or
      normal Black volatility (if True).
      Default value: False, which corresponds to lognormal volatility.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: `None` which maps to the default dtype inferred by
        TensorFlow.
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` which is mapped to the default name `option_price`.

  Returns:
    option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The Black
    Scholes price of the options.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is
      supplied.
    ValueError: If both `discount_rates` and `discount_factors` is supplied.

      that broadcasts with `volatilities`. True if barrier is below asset
      price at expiration.
      Default value: `True`.

  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      If not `None`, discount factors are calculated as e^(-rT),
      where r are the discount rates, or risk free rates. At most one of
      discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      discount_factors also not given.
    dividend_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to q = 0.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not None, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). If None, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not None then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      Default value: None, equivalent to discount factors = 1.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    is_normal_volatility: An optional Python boolean specifying whether the
      `volatilities` correspond to lognormal Black volatility (if False) or
      normal Black volatility (if True).
      Default value: False, which corresponds to lognormal volatility.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by TensorFlow
        (float32).
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `binary_price`.

  Returns:

  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The Black volatilities
      of the swaptions to price. The shape of this input determines the number
      (and shape) of swaptions to be priced and the shape of the output.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `volatilities`. The
      time to expiration of the swaptions.
    floating_leg_start_times: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype as
      `volatilities`. The times when accrual begins for each payment in the
      floating leg. The shape of this input should be `expiries.shape + [m]` or
      `batch_shape + [m]` where `m` denotes the number of floating payments in
      each leg.
    floating_leg_end_times: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype as `volatilities`.
      The times when accrual ends for each payment in the floating leg. The
      shape of this input should be `batch_shape + [m]` where `m` denotes
      the number of floating payments in each leg.
    fixed_leg_payment_times: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype as
      `volatilities`.  The payment times for each payment in the fixed leg.
      The shape of this input should be `batch_shape + [n]` where `n` denotes
      the number of fixed payments in each leg.
    floating_leg_daycount_fractions: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and
      compatible shape as `floating_leg_start_times`. The daycount fractions
      for each payment in the floating leg.
    fixed_leg_daycount_fractions: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and
      compatible shape as `fixed_leg_payment_times`. The daycount fractions
      for each payment in the fixed leg.
    fixed_leg_coupon: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and shape compatible
      to `batch_shape`. The fixed coupon rate for each payment in the fixed leg.
    floating_leg_start_times_discount_factors: A real `Tensor` of the same
      shape and dtype as `floating_leg_start_times`. The discount factors
      corresponding to `floating_leg_start_times`.
    floating_leg_end_times_discount_factors: A real `Tensor` of the same
      shape and dtype as `floating_leg_end_times`. The discount factors
      corresponding to `floating_leg_end_times`.
    fixed_leg_payment_times_discount_factors: A real `Tensor` of the same
      shape and dtype as `fixed_leg_payment_times`. The discount factors
      corresponding to `fixed_leg_payment_times`.
    notional: An optional `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities` specifying the notional amount for the underlying swap.
       Default value: None in which case the notional is set to 1.
    is_payer_swaption: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with `expiries`.
      Indicates whether the swaption is a payer (if True) or a receiver
      (if False) swaption. If not supplied, payer swaptions are assumed.
    is_normal_volatility: An optional Python boolean specifying whether the
      `volatilities` correspond to normal Black volatility (if True) or
      lognormal Black volatility (if False).
      Default value: True, which corresponds to normal volatility.
    dtype: The default dtype to use when converting values to `Tensor`s.
      Default value: `None` which means that default dtypes inferred by
      TensorFlow are used.
    name: Python string. The name to give to the ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` which maps to the default name
      `hw_swaption_price`.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of real dtype and shape `batch_shape` containing the
    computed swaption prices.
