    The pyre flavor acts as a name of a particular language-server + daemon
    pair. Its value is a factor in determining socket and log paths, which
    have to be kept separate if we are running multiple language servers
    in parallel, as well as tagging telemetry data.

    On the client side, the enum value is only really important for language
    servers, which are long-lived and in most cases need custom daemons.

    All standard pyre commands use the CLASSIC daemon.

    The flavor is restricted to be one of a few known options because we rely
    on the values for metrics and also because we depend on the names being
    short enough not to exceed socket path limits.
