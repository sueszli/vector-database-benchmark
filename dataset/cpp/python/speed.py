def add_edge_speeds(G, hwy_speeds=None, fallback=None, precision=None, agg=np.mean):
    """
    Add edge speeds (km per hour) to graph as new `speed_kph` edge attributes.

    By default, this imputes free-flow travel speeds for all edges via the
    mean `maxspeed` value of the edges of each highway type. For highway types
    in the graph that have no `maxspeed` value on any edge, it assigns the
    mean of all `maxspeed` values in graph.

    This default mean-imputation can obviously be imprecise, and the user can
    override it by passing in `hwy_speeds` and/or `fallback` arguments that
    correspond to local speed limit standards. The user can also specify a
    different aggregation function (such as the median) to impute missing
    values from the observed values.

    If edge `maxspeed` attribute has "mph" in it, value will automatically be
    converted from miles per hour to km per hour. Any other speed units should
    be manually converted to km per hour prior to running this function,
    otherwise there could be unexpected results. If "mph" does not appear in
    the edge's maxspeed attribute string, then function assumes kph, per OSM
    guidelines: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
        input graph
    hwy_speeds : dict
        dict keys = OSM highway types and values = typical speeds (km per
        hour) to assign to edges of that highway type for any edges missing
        speed data. Any edges with highway type not in `hwy_speeds` will be
        assigned the mean preexisting speed value of all edges of that highway
        type.
    fallback : numeric
        default speed value (km per hour) to assign to edges whose highway
        type did not appear in `hwy_speeds` and had no preexisting speed
        values on any edge
    precision : int
        deprecated, do not use
    agg : function
        aggregation function to impute missing values from observed values.
        the default is numpy.mean, but you might also consider for example
        numpy.median, numpy.nanmedian, or your own custom function
