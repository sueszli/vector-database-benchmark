"""Illustrates a global criteria applied to entities of a particular type.

The example here is the "public" flag, a simple boolean that indicates
the rows are part of a publicly viewable subcategory.  Rows that do not
include this flag are not shown unless a special option is passed to the
query.

Uses for this kind of recipe include tables that have "soft deleted" rows
marked as "deleted" that should be skipped, rows that have access control rules
that should be applied on a per-request basis, etc.
