Module for the :class:`IssueFinder` class, which is responsible for configuring,
creating and running issue managers.

It determines which types of issues to look for, instatiates the IssueManagers
via a factory, run the issue managers
(:py:meth:`IssueManager.find_issues <cleanlab.datalab.internal.issue_manager.issue_manager.IssueManager.find_issues>`),
and collects the results to :py:class:`DataIssues <cleanlab.datalab.internal.data_issues.DataIssues>`.

.. note::

    This module is not intended to be used directly. Instead, use the public-facing
    :py:meth:`Datalab.find_issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.find_issues>` method.

    The IssueFinder class is responsible for managing the process of identifying
    issues in the dataset by handling the creation and execution of relevant
    IssueManagers. It serves as a coordinator or helper class for the Datalab class
    to encapsulate the specific behavior of the issue finding process.

    At a high level, the IssueFinder is responsible for:

    - Determining which types of issues to look for.
    - Instantiating the appropriate IssueManagers using a factory.
    - Running the IssueManagers' `find_issues` methods.
    - Collecting the results into a DataIssues instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datalab : Datalab
        The Datalab instance associated with this IssueFinder.

    verbosity : int
        Controls the verbosity of the output during the issue finding process.

    Note
    ----
    This class is not intended to be used directly. Instead, use the
    `Datalab.find_issues` method which internally utilizes an IssueFinder instance.

        Checks the dataset for all sorts of common issues in real-world data (in both labels and feature values).

        You can use Datalab to find issues in your data, utilizing *any* model you have already trained.
        This method only interacts with your model via its predictions or embeddings (and other functions thereof).
        The more of these inputs you provide, the more types of issues Datalab can detect in your dataset/labels.
        If you provide a subset of these inputs, Datalab will output what insights it can based on the limited information from your model.

        This method is not intended to be used directly. Instead, use the
        :py:meth:`Datalab.find_issues <cleanlab.datalab.datalab.Datalab.find_issues>` method.

        Note
        ----
        The issues are saved in the ``self.datalab.data_issues.issues`` attribute, but are not returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pred_probs :
            Out-of-sample predicted class probabilities made by the model for every example in the dataset.
            To best detect label issues, provide this input obtained from the most accurate model you can produce.

            If provided, this must be a 2D array with shape (num_examples, K) where K is the number of classes in the dataset.

        features : Optional[np.ndarray]
            Feature embeddings (vector representations) of every example in the dataset.

            If provided, this must be a 2D array with shape (num_examples, num_features).

        knn_graph :
            Sparse matrix representing distances between examples in the dataset in a k nearest neighbor graph.

            If provided, this must be a square CSR matrix with shape (num_examples, num_examples) and (k*num_examples) non-zero entries (k is the number of nearest neighbors considered for each example)
            evenly distributed across the rows.
            The non-zero entries must be the distances between the corresponding examples. Self-distances must be omitted
            (i.e. the diagonal must be all zeros and the k nearest neighbors of each example must not include itself).

            For any duplicated examples i,j whose distance is 0, there should be an *explicit* zero stored in the matrix, i.e. ``knn_graph[i,j] = 0``.

            If both `knn_graph` and `features` are provided, the `knn_graph` will take precendence.
            If `knn_graph` is not provided, it is constructed based on the provided `features`.
            If neither `knn_graph` nor `features` are provided, certain issue types like (near) duplicates will not be considered.

        issue_types :
            Collection specifying which types of issues to consider in audit and any non-default parameter settings to use.
            If unspecified, a default set of issue types and recommended parameter settings is considered.

            This is a dictionary of dictionaries, where the keys are the issue types of interest
            and the values are dictionaries of parameter values that control how each type of issue is detected (only for advanced users).
            More specifically, the values are constructor keyword arguments passed to the corresponding ``IssueManager``,
            which is responsible for detecting the particular issue type.
