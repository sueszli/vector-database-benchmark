### <summary>
### Demonstration algorithm showing how to easily convert an old algorithm into the framework.
###
###  1. When making orders, also create insights for the correct direction (up/down/flat), can also set insight prediction period/magnitude/direction
###  2. Emit insights before placing any trades
###  3. Profit :)
