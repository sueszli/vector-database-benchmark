/**
@class EE::Network::SocketSelector

Socket selectors provide a way to wait until some data is
available on a set of sockets, instead of just one. This
is convenient when you have multiple sockets that may
possibly receive data, but you don't know which one will
be ready first. In particular, it avoids to use a thread
for each socket; with selectors, a single thread can handle
all the sockets.

All types of sockets can be used in a selector:
@li EE::NetworkTcpListener
@li EE::NetworkTcpSocket
@li EE::NetworkUdpSocket

A selector doesn't store its own copies of the sockets
(socket classes are not copyable anyway), it simply keeps
a reference to the original sockets that you pass to the
"add" function. Therefore, you can't use the selector as a
socket container, you must store them oustide and make sure
that they are alive as long as they are used in the selector.

Using a selector is simple:
@li populate the selector with all the sockets that you want to observe
@li make it wait until there is data available on any of the sockets
@li test each socket to find out which ones are ready

Usage example:
@code
// Create a socket to listen to new connections
TcpListener listener;
listener.listen(55001);

// Create a list to store the future clients
std::vector<TcpSocket*> clients;

// Create a selector
SocketSelector selector;

// Add the listener to the selector
selector.add(listener);

// Endless loop that waits for new connections
while (running) {
	 // Make the selector wait for data on any socket
	 if (selector.wait()) {
		 // Test the listener
		 if (selector.isReady(listener)) {
			 // The listener is ready: there is a pending connection
			 TcpSocket* client = new TcpSocket;
			 if (listener.accept(*client) == Socket::Done) {
				 // Add the new client to the clients list
				 clients.push_back(client);

				 // Add the new client to the selector so that we will
				 // be notified when he sends something
				 selector.add(*client);
			 } else {
				 // Error, we won't get a new connection, delete the socket
				 delete client;
			 }
		 } else {
			 // The listener socket is not ready, test all other sockets (the clients)
			 for (std::vector<TcpSocket*>::iterator it = clients.begin(); it != clients.end(); ++it) {
				 TcpSocket& client = **it;
				 if (selector.isReady(client)) {
					 // The client has sent some data, we can receive it
					 Packet packet;
					 if (client.Receive(packet) == Socket::Done) {
						 ...
					 }
				 }
			 }
		 }
	 }
}
