/* these functions only initialize the fields added on top of
 * LogProtoServerOptions, the rest is the responsibility of the LogReader.
 * This whole Options structure has become very messy. There are a lot of them.
 *
 *   FileReaderOptions ->
 *       LogReaderOptions ->
 *           LogProtoServerOptions
 *              This is actually a LogProtoServerOptionsStorage structure
 *              which holds a LogProtoFileReaderOptions instance and the
 *              LogReader only stores it.
 *
 * FileOpenerOptions is fortunately independent of this mess.
 *
 * LogProtoFileReaderOptions only needs to take care about its "extra"
 * fields on top of LogProtoServerOptions, that's why we don't call anything
 * from the "inherited" class.  This is because that class is
 * defaulted/initialized/destroyed by LogReader.  This layer just manages
 * what we happen to store in addition to LogProtoServerOptions.
 *
 * You have been warned!
 *
 * PS: I attempted to refactor this, but at first try it became more messy, so I
 * abandoned it, but it should be done eventually.
