    * The code here below will almost never be triggered as it handles a very
    * ugly use case. Let me explain.
    *
    * In order to fat_mmap() work in the simple and direct way as implemented
    * in Tilck, the FAT clusters must be aligned at page boundary. That is true
    * when just the first data sector is aligned. In our build system, the
    * fathack build app is used to make that happen. Fathack substantially calls
    * fat_align_first_data_sector() which adds more reserved sectors to the
    * partition by shifting all the data by the necessary amount of bytes.
    *
    * Now, when our FAT ramdisk is build by our build system, because of fathack
    * we never have to worry about such alignment. That is true even if the
    * fat ramdisk is later modified by an external tool to add/remove files from
    * it: the number of reserved sectors won't changed. BUT, in the unlikely
    * case when the external tools reformats the whole partition, we'll loose
    * that alignment and it would be nice if Tilck itself could handle that case
    * too. That's what the following code does.
    *
    * Note: in order to the code below to work (corner case, like explained) we
    * need at least one of the following conditions to be true:
    *
    *    - boot the OS using one of Tilck's bootloaders OR
    *    - have 1 page avail at the end of the ramdisk mem region (very likely)
    *
    * In summary, the code below won't work only in the 1 in billion case where
    * all of the following statements are true:
    *
    *    - the fatpart was NOT generated by our build system (why doing that?)
    *    - the OS was NOT booted using Tilck's bootloaders (e.g. using GRUB)
    *    - according to the firmware, the next 4k after the ramdisk belong
    *      to a reserved memory region (extremely unlucky case)
