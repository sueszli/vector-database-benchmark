/* This is a program that does nothing, and returns zero. It is exactly the
same as the Unix "true" utility. Why do we need it? Well, not all systems have
"true" in the same place, and sometimes it's a shell built-in. Given that we
have little utilities anyway, it's just easier to do this. As for its name,
those with IBM mainframe memories will know where that comes from. */
