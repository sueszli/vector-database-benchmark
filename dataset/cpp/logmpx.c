  /* NOTE: non of our multiplexed next-hops delivered this message, let's
   * propagate this result.  But only if we don't have a "next".  If we do,
   * that would be responsible for doing the same, for instance if it is a
   * filter.
   *
   * There are three distinct cases where LogMultiplexer is used:
   *
   *   1) at the tail of a LogSource, where the multiplexer is used to
   *   dispatch messages along all log statements that reference the
   *   specific source.  In this case pipe_next is NULL, only next_hops are
   *   used to connect parallel branches
   *
   *   2) as the head element of a junction, in this case pipe_next is NULL,
   *   next_hops contain the branches of the junction.  Subsequent LogPipes
   *   in the current sequence are attached at the "join_pipe" which is
   *   connected to all parallel branches of the junction.
   *
   *   3) when we connect the logpath to destinations.  In this case
   *   next_hops contain the destinations we want to deliver to.  pipe_next
   *   is used to continue along the current logpath.
   *
   * Conceptually, the matched value we propagate to our parent logpath
   * determines if our parent considers this message matched or not matched
   * by this element.
   *
   *   - If we did match (e.g. delivered == TRUE), nothing is to be done.
   *
   *   - If we did not match (e.g.  delivered == FALSE), we may need to
   *   propagate this result to our parent by setting
   *   (*path_options->matched) to FALSE.
   *
   * In the cases of 1) and 2) we perform a filtering function and we want
   * to tell our parent that we did NOT match so it can attempt another
   * route. We need to set matched to FALSE;
   *
   * In the case of 3) we dispatched to one or more destinations and even if
   * those destinations drop our message on the floor, we are not interested.
   * "matched" will be determined by all filtering elements on the log
   * path and we are not one of them.
   *
   * We differentiate between 1, 2 and 3 based on the value of
   * self->delivery_propagation which is set during compilation.  If
   * delivery_propagation is not set, we are just here for dispatching to
   * destinations (e.g.  we need to ignore their outcome), otherwise we
   * perform a filtering function, which means we need to push our filtering
   * responsibility to the next pipe element.
