// 00dummy_tester.cpp - Not to be included in the DLL
// This file is only to be able to generate an object file by including a single header file,
// to be able to run "dumpbin /symbols" on it and thereby help decoupling the compile-time dependencies.

// The project file preprocessor definitions are currently set to test:
//  xrGame.dll

//#include "xrSound/Sound.h"
#include "xrGame/stalker_movement_manager_smart_cover.h"
