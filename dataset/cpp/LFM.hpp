 * The LFM algorithm detects overlapping communities by repeatedly
 * executing a given SelectiveCommunityDetector algorithm
 * for different random seed nodes which have not yet been assigned to any community.
 * While this implementation allows the use of any local community detection algorithm, the behavior
 * of the original algorithm can be achieved using the LFMLocal local community detection algorithm.
