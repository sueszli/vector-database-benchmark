Description: 
    HLS Dataflow Example using array of HLS Stream datatype
    This example is N Stages of Vector Addition to demonstrate Array of 
    Stream usage in HLS C Kernel. 

    1) read_input(): 
        This API reads the input vector from Global Memory and writes it into 
        HLS Stream inStream using blocking write command.

    2) Multiple instance of Adder(): 
        This API reads the input vector from inStream using blocking
        read command and increment the value by user specified increment. It writes 
        the results into outStream using blocking write command.

    3) write_result(): 
        This API reads the result vector from outStream using blocking read
        command and write the result into Global Memory Location.
        
    Four Stage Adder will be implemented as below:
