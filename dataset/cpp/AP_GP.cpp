/*  Title : To find whether the given series format is following AP or GP .
    Description : User need to provide the terms present and also need to mention
                  how many number of terms user is providing .
                  You can also find the ' Mean' , ' Sum ' and the nth the term if
                  it is following any one of the of progression .
                  Need to enter atleast three minimun number .
                *****  For A.P and G.P , here the common difference , common ratio should be greater than 1 .******
