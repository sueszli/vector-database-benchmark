// Statement
In Ninja Land, there is a famous restaurant named 'CookingNinjas'. 
There are 'N' cooks in 'CookingNinjas' numbered from 0 to N-1. Each cook has rank 'R' (1 <=R <= 10).

A cook with a rank 'R' can prepare 1 dish in the first 'R' minutes, 1 more dish in the next '2R' minutes, 
1 more dish in next '3R' minutes, and so on (A cook can only make complete dishes).
For example if a cook is ranked 2. He will prepare one dish in 2 minutes, one more dish in the next 4 mins 
and one more in the next 6 minutes hence in a total of 12 minutes he can make 3 dishes, 
Note, In 13 minutes also he can make only 3 dishes as he does not have enough time for the 4th dish).

One day 'CookingNinjas' receive an order of 'M' dishes that they need to complete as early as possible. 
You are given an integer array rank' of size 'N' in which rank[gives "rank' of ith cook and an integer 
'M', You need to find out the minimum times required to complete this order of 'M' dishes.

// Example
Input:- arr=>[1,2,3,4] and M=11
Output:- 12

Explanation:- Let 'N' = 4, 'ranks' = [1, 2, 3, 4] and 'M' = 11. Then the minimum time required to cook 11 
dishes will be 12 minutes. The cooks should prepare dishes in the following manner -: 
Cook-0 prepare 4 dishes in 10 minutes i.e (1 dish in 1 minute, 1 more dish in next 2 minutes, 
       1 more dish in next 3 minutes,1 more dish in next 4 minutes).
Cook-1 prepare 3 dishes in 12 minutes i.e (1 dish in 2 minutes, 1 more dish in 4 minutes, 1 more dish in 
       6 minutes). 
Cook-2 prepare 2 dishes in 9 minutes i.e (1 dish in 3 minutes, 1 more dish in the next 6 minutes). 
Cook-3 prepare 2 dishes in 12 minutes i.e (1 dish in 4 minutes, 1 more dish in the next 8 minutes). 

If all four cooks work simultaneously then they can prepare(4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11) dishes in 12 minutes. 
And it is the minimum possible time.
