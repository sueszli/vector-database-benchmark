/*
 * Check if statement can be implemented by a single request to the DocDB.
 *
 * An insert, update, or delete command makes one or more write requests to
 * the DocDB to apply the changes, and may also make read requests to find
 * the target row, its id, current values, etc. Complex expressions (e.g.
 * subqueries, stored functions) may also make requests to DocDB.
 *
 * Typically multiple requests require a transaction to maintain consistency.
 * However, if the command is about to make single write request, it is OK to
 * skip the transaction. The ModifyTable plan node makes one write request per
 * row it fetches from its subplans, therefore the key criteria of single row
 * modify is a single Result plan node in the ModifyTable's plans list.
 * Plain Result plan node produces exactly one row without making requests to
 * the DocDB, unless it has a subplan or complex expressions to evaluate.
 *
 * Full list of the conditions we check here:
 *  - there is only one target table;
 *  - there is no ON CONFLICT clause;
 *  - there is no init plan;
 *  - there is only one source plan, which is a simple form of Result;
 *  - all expressions in the Result's target list and in the returning list are
 *    simple, that means they do not need to access the DocDB.
 *
 * Additionally, during execution we will also check:
 *  - not in transaction block;
 *  - is a single-plan execution;
 *  - target table has no triggers to fire;
 *  - target table has no indexes to update.
 * And if all are true we will execute this op as a single-row transaction
 * rather than a distributed transaction.
