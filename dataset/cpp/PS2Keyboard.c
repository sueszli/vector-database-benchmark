  ** Modified for easy interrup pin assignement on method begin(datapin,irq_pin). Cuningan <cuninganreset@gmail.com> **

  for more information you can read the original wiki in arduino.cc
  at http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/PS2Keyboard
  or http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_PS2Keyboard.html

  Version 2.4 (March 2013)
  - Support Teensy 3.0, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo & other boards
  - French keyboard layout, David Chochoi, tchoyyfr at yahoo dot fr

  Version 2.3 (October 2011)
  - Minor bugs fixed

  Version 2.2 (August 2011)
  - Support non-US keyboards - thanks to Rainer Bruch for a German keyboard :)

  Version 2.1 (May 2011)
  - timeout to recover from misaligned input
  - compatibility with Arduino "new-extension" branch
  - TODO: send function, proposed by Scott Penrose, scooterda at me dot com

  Version 2.0 (June 2010)
  - Buffering added, many scan codes can be captured without data loss
    if your sketch is busy doing other work
  - Shift keys supported, completely rewritten scan code to ascii
  - Slow linear search replaced with fast indexed table lookups
  - Support for Teensy, Arduino Mega, and Sanguino added
