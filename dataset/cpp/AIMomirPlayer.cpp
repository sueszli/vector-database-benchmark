    /*
     Another gift from Alex Majlaton on my first day playing Momir, and it has served me well ever since. It goes a little something like this: (a) if you are on the play, hit your Two through Four, skip your Five, and then hit all the way to Eight; (b) if you are on the draw and your opponent skips his One, you make Two through Eight; (c) if you are on the draw and your opponent hits a One, you match him drop-for-drop for the rest of the game.

     You skip your Five on the play because it is the weakest drop. There are plenty of serviceable guys there, but very few bombs compared to other drops
     the general rule is this: if you want to get to Eight, you have to skip two drops on the play and one drop on the draw.
