// This class definition doesn't have full functionality defined yet.
// You might want to try implementing some more features yourself.
// For example, you need a public method that allows adding a left or
// right child, and so on.

// Note that this .hpp file is just another header file, to be included
// by the first header file. The idea is that templated class code needs
// to be defined in headers, but you still might want to neatly separate
// the code into separate files.

// We still wrote the preprocessor directives shown above, to illustrate
// a common way to handle this situation: If the users mistakenly include
// the wrong header when they use your library, it won't matter this way,
// because either header will correctly pull in the other header.
