class ValidationMixin:
    """Mixin class that allows custom validation for various parts of InvenTree

    Custom generation and validation functionality can be provided for:

    - Part names
    - Part IPN (internal part number) values
    - Part parameter values
    - Serial numbers
    - Batch codes

    Notes:
    - Multiple ValidationMixin plugins can be used simultaneously
    - The stub methods provided here generally return None (null value).
    - The "first" plugin to return a non-null value for a particular method "wins"
    - In the case of "validation" functions, all loaded plugins are checked until an exception is thrown

    Implementing plugins may override any of the following methods which are of interest.

    For 'validation' methods, there are three 'acceptable' outcomes:
    - The method determines that the value is 'invalid' and raises a django.core.exceptions.ValidationError
    - The method passes and returns None (the code then moves on to the next plugin)
    - The method passes and returns True (and no subsequent plugins are checked)
