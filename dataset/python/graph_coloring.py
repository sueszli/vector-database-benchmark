class GraphColoringModel(_ModelBase):
    """
    A GraphColoringModel object contains color ID assignments for each vertex
    and the total number of colors used in coloring the entire graph.

    The coloring is the result of a greedy algorithm and therefore is not
    optimal.  Finding optimal coloring is in fact NP-complete.

    Below is a list of queryable fields for this model:

    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | Field          | Description                                         |
    +================+=====================================================+
    | graph          | A new SGraph with the color id as a vertex property |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | training_time  | Total training time of the model                    |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | num_colors     | Number of colors in the graph                       |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

    This model cannot be constructed directly.  Instead, use
    :func:`turicreate.graph_coloring.create` to create an instance
    of this model. A detailed list of parameter options and code samples
    are available in the documentation for the create function.

def create(graph, verbose=True):
    """
    Compute the graph coloring. Assign a color to each vertex such that no
    adjacent vertices have the same color. Return a model object with total
    number of colors used as well as the color ID for each vertex in the graph.
    This algorithm is greedy and is not guaranteed to find the **minimum** graph
    coloring. It is also not deterministic, so successive runs may return
    different answers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : SGraph
        The graph on which to compute the coloring.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print progress updates.

    Returns
    -------
    out : GraphColoringModel

    References
    ----------
    - `Wikipedia - graph coloring <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring>`_

    Examples
    --------
    If given an :class:`~turicreate.SGraph` ``g``, we can create
    a :class:`~turicreate.graph_coloring.GraphColoringModel` as follows:

    >>> g = turicreate.load_sgraph('http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.txt.gz', format='snap')
    >>> gc = turicreate.graph_coloring.create(g)

    We can obtain the ``color id`` corresponding to each vertex in the graph ``g``
    as follows:

    >>> color_id = gc['color_id']  # SFrame

    We can obtain the total number of colors required to color the graph ``g``
    as follows:

    >>> num_colors = gc['num_colors']
