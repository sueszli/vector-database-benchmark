  """Performs one step of the one dimensional parabolic PDE solver.

  Typically one doesn't need to call this function directly, unless they have
  a custom time marching scheme. A simple stepper function for one-dimensional
  PDEs can be found in `crank_nicolson.py`.

  For a given solution (given by the `value_grid`) of a parabolic PDE at a given
  `time` on a given `coord_grid` computes an approximate solution at the
  `next_time` on the same coordinate grid. The parabolic differential equation
  is of the form:

  ```none
   dV/dt + a * d2(A * V)/dx2 + b * d(B * V)/dx + c * V = 0
  ```
  Here `a`, `A`, `b`, `B`, and `c` are known coefficients which may depend on
  `x` and `t`; `V = V(t, x)` is the solution to be found.

  Args:
    time: Real scalar `Tensor`. The time before the step.
    next_time: Real scalar `Tensor`. The time after the step.
    coord_grid: List of size 1 that contains a rank 1 real `Tensor` of
      has shape `[d]` or `B + [d]` where `d` is the size of the grid and `B` is
      a batch shape. Represents the coordinates of the grid points.
    value_grid: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
      `time` which have to be evolved to time `next_time`. The shape of the
      `Tensor` must broadcast with `B + [d]`. `B` is the batch
      dimensions (one or more), which allow multiple functions (with potentially
      different boundary/final conditions and PDE coefficients) to be evolved
      simultaneously.
    boundary_conditions: The boundary conditions. Only rectangular
      boundary conditions are supported. A list of tuples of size 1. The list
      element is a tuple that consists of two callables or `None`s representing
      the boundary conditions at the minimum and maximum values of the spatial
      variable indexed by the position in the list. `boundary_conditions[0][0]`
      describes the boundary at `x_min`, and `boundary_conditions[0][1]` the
      boundary at `x_max`. `None` values mean that the second order term on the
      boundary is assumed to be zero, i.e.,
      'dV/dt + b * d(B * V)/dx + c * V = 0'. This condition is appropriate for
      PDEs where the second order term disappears on the boundary. For not
      `None` values, the boundary conditions are accepted in the form
      `alpha(t) V + beta(t) V_n = gamma(t)`,
      where `V_n` is the derivative with respect to the exterior normal to the
      boundary. Each callable receives the current time `t` and the `coord_grid`
      at the current time, and should return a tuple of `alpha`, `beta`, and
      `gamma`. Each can be a number, a zero-rank `Tensor` or a `Tensor` of the
      batch shape.
      For example, for a grid of shape `(b, n)`, where `b` is the batch size,
      `boundary_conditions[0][0]` should return a tuple of either numbers,
      zero-rank tensors or tensors of shape `(b, n)`.
      `alpha` and `beta` can also be `None` in case of Neumann and
      Dirichlet conditions, respectively.
    second_order_coeff_fn: Callable returning the second order coefficient
      `a(t, r)` evaluated at given time `t`.
      The callable accepts the following arguments:
        `t`: The time at which the coefficient should be evaluated.
        `locations_grid`: a `Tensor` representing a grid of locations `r` at
          which the coefficient should be evaluated.
      Returns an object `A` such that `A[0][0]` is defined and equals
      `a(r, t)`. `A[0][0]` should be a Number, a `Tensor` broadcastable to the
      shape of the grid represented by `locations_grid`, or `None` if
      corresponding term is absent in the equation. Also, the callable itself
      may be None, meaning there are no second-order derivatives in the
      equation.
    first_order_coeff_fn: Callable returning the first order coefficient
      `b(t, r)` evaluated at given time `t`.
      The callable accepts the following arguments:
        `t`: The time at which the coefficient should be evaluated.
        `locations_grid`: a `Tensor` representing a grid of locations `r` at
          which the coefficient should be evaluated.
      Returns a list or an 1D `Tensor`, `0`-th element of which represents
      `b(t, r)`. This element should be a Number, a `Tensor` broadcastable
       to the shape of the grid represented by `locations_grid`, or None if
       corresponding term is absent in the equation. The callable itself may be
       None, meaning there are no first-order derivatives in the equation.
    zeroth_order_coeff_fn: Callable returning the zeroth order coefficient
      `c(t, r)` evaluated at given time `t`.
      The callable accepts the following arguments:
        `t`: The time at which the coefficient should be evaluated.
        `locations_grid`: a `Tensor` representing a grid of locations `r` at
          which the coefficient should be evaluated.
      Should return a Number or a `Tensor` broadcastable to the shape of
      the grid represented by `locations_grid`. May also return None or be None
      if the shift term is absent in the equation.
    inner_second_order_coeff_fn: Callable returning the coefficients under the
      second derivatives (i.e. `A(t, x)` above) at given time `t`. The
      requirements are the same as for `second_order_coeff_fn`.
    inner_first_order_coeff_fn: Callable returning the coefficients under the
      first derivatives (i.e. `B(t, x)` above) at given time `t`. The
      requirements are the same as for `first_order_coeff_fn`.
    time_marching_scheme: A callable which represents the time marching scheme
      for solving the PDE equation. If `u(t)` is space-discretized vector of the
      solution of the PDE, this callable approximately solves the equation
      `du/dt = A(t) u(t)` for `u(t1)` given `u(t2)`. Here `A` is a tridiagonal
      matrix. The callable consumes the following arguments by keyword:
        1. inner_value_grid: Grid of solution values at the current time of
          the same `dtype` as `value_grid` and shape of `value_grid[..., 1:-1]`.
        2. t1: Time before the step.
        3. t2: Time after the step.
        4. equation_params_fn: A callable that takes a scalar `Tensor` argument
          representing time, and constructs the tridiagonal matrix `A`
          (a tuple of three `Tensor`s, main, upper, and lower diagonals)
          and the inhomogeneous term `b`. All of the `Tensor`s are of the same
          `dtype` as `values_inner_value_grid` and of the shape
          broadcastable with the shape of `inner_value_grid`.
      The callable should return a `Tensor` of the same shape and `dtype` a
      `value_grid` and represents an approximate solution of the PDE after one
      iteraton.
    dtype: The dtype to use.
    name: The name to give to the ops.
      Default value: None which means `parabolic_equation_step` is used.

  Returns:
    A sequence of two `Tensor`s. The first one is a `Tensor` of the same
    `dtype` and `shape` as `coord_grid` and represents a new coordinate grid
    after one iteration. The second `Tensor` is of the same shape and `dtype`
    as`value_grid` and represents an approximate solution of the equation after
    one iteration.
