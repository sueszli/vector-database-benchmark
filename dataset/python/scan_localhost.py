"""Script designed to scan a server running on localhost:443.

This is used in CI to ensure SSLyze is able to scan specific web servers (Apache2, IIS, etc.) running on localhost:443
with client authentication required.
.
See ./.github/workflows and https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze/issues/472 for more details.
