    """
    Create a DBSCAN clustering model. The DBSCAN method partitions the input
    dataset into three types of points, based on the estimated probability
    density at each point.

    - **Core** points have a large number of points within a given neighborhood.
      Specifically, `min_core_neighbors` must be within distance `radius` of a
      point for it to be considered a core point.

    - **Boundary** points are within distance `radius` of a core point, but
      don't have sufficient neighbors of their own to be considered core.

    - **Noise** points comprise the remainder of the data. These points have too
      few neighbors to be considered core points, and are further than distance
      `radius` from all core points.

    Clusters are formed by connecting core points that are neighbors of each
    other, then assigning boundary points to their nearest core neighbor's
    cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : SFrame
        Training data, with each row corresponding to an observation. Must
        include all features specified in the `features` parameter, but may have
        additional columns as well.

    features : list[str], optional
        Name of the columns with features to use in comparing records. 'None'
        (the default) indicates that all columns of the input `dataset` should
        be used to train the model. All features must be numeric, i.e. integer
        or float types.

    distance : str or list[list], optional
        Function to measure the distance between any two input data rows. This
        may be one of two types:

        - *String*: the name of a standard distance function. One of
          'euclidean', 'squared_euclidean', 'manhattan', 'levenshtein',
          'jaccard', 'weighted_jaccard', 'cosine', or 'transformed_dot_product'.

        - *Composite distance*: the weighted sum of several standard distance
          functions applied to various features. This is specified as a list of
          distance components, each of which is itself a list containing three
          items:

          1. list or tuple of feature names (str)

          2. standard distance name (str)

          3. scaling factor (int or float)

        For more information about Turi Create distance functions, please
        see the :py:mod:`~turicreate.toolkits.distances` module.

        For sparse vectors, missing keys are assumed to have value 0.0.

        If 'distance' is left unspecified, a composite distance is constructed
        automatically based on feature types.

    radius : int or float, optional
        Size of each point's neighborhood, with respect to the specified
        distance function.

    min_core_neighbors : int, optional
        Number of neighbors that must be within distance `radius` of a point in
        order for that point to be considered a "core point" of a cluster.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print progress updates and model details during model creation.

    Returns
    -------
    out : DBSCANModel
        A model containing a cluster label for each row in the input `dataset`.
        Also contains the indices of the core points, cluster boundary points,
        and noise points.

    See Also

    Notes
    -----
    - Our implementation of DBSCAN first computes the similarity graph on the
      input dataset, which can be a computationally intensive process. In the
      current implementation, some distances are substantially faster than
      others; in particular "euclidean", "squared_euclidean", "cosine", and
      "transformed_dot_product" are quite fast, while composite distances can be
      slow.

    - Any distance function in the Turi Create library may be used with DBSCAN but
      the results may be poor for distances that violate the standard metric
      properties, i.e. symmetry, non-negativity, triangle inequality, and
      identity of indiscernibles. In particular, the DBSCAN algorithm is based
      on the concept of connecting high-density points that are *close* to each
      other into a single cluster, but the notion of *close* may be very
      counterintuitive if the chosen distance function is not a valid metric.
      The distances "euclidean", "manhattan", "jaccard", and "levenshtein" will
      likely yield the best results.
