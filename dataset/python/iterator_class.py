Iterator classes implement the `__iter__` and `__next__` magic methods.

employee in a hierarchy one-by-one. This module also shows how a similar
approach can be achieved with a generator function.

    An iterator class is composed of three methods:

    - A constructor which defines data structures

    - A retriever which gets the next element

    call them d-under methods because they have double-underscores.

    It is essentially the same logic as above except constructed as a
    generator function. Notice that the generator code is in a single
    place, whereas the iterator code is in multiple places. Also notice
    that we are using the `yield` keyword in the generator code.

    It is a matter of preference and context that we choose one approach
    over the other. If we want something simple, go with the generator.
    Otherwise, go with the iterator to fulfill more demanding requirements.
    In this case, examples of such requirements are tasks like encrypting
    the employee's username, running statistics on iterated employees or
    excluding the reports under a particular set of managers.
