    Target Generation
    -----------------

    the target value is a linear
    combination of the features chosen for each row plus uniform noise.

    - For each numeric and vector columns, each value, with the range
      scaled to [-0.5, 0.5] (so r and R type values affect the target just
      as much as n an N), is added to the target value.  NaNs are ignored.

    - For each categorical or string values, it is hash-mapped to a lookup
      table of 512 randomly chosen values, each in [-0.5, 0.5], and the
      result is added to the target.

    - For dictionary columns, the keys are treated as adding a categorical
      value and the values are treated as adding a numeric value.

    At the end, a uniform random value is added to the target in the
    range [(max_target - min_target) * noise_level], where max_target
    and min_target are the maximum and minimum target values generated
    by the above process.

    The final target values are then scaled to [0, 1].

    Target Generation
    -----------------

    The target column, called "target", is an integer value that
    represents the binning of the output of a noisy linear function of
    the chosen random variables into `num_classes + num_extra_class_bins`
    bins, shuffled, and then each bin is mapped to a class.  This
    means that some non-linearity is present if num_extra_class_bins > 0.
    The default value for num_extra_class_bins is 2*num_classes.

    The `misclassification_probability` controls the spread of the
    binning -- if misclassification_spread equals 0.25, then a random
    variable of 0.25 * bin_width is added to the numeric prediction of
    the class, meaning the actual class may be mispredicted.
