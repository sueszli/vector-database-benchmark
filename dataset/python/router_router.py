"""
ROUTER-ROUTER communication example

ideal for P2P applications that need a socket that is able to connect
to several other peers simultaneously, while also being able
to receive messages

In this example, aiowire.EventLoop is used to await all tasks launched
within it, while timing out after (here) 1 second.
This guarantees completion of tasks - even if they are infinite loops
- as long as they regularly call await.
