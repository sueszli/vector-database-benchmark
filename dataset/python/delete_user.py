Delete a user or users, including all messages sent by them and
personal messages received by them, and audit records, like what
streams they had been subscribed to. Deactivating users is generally
recommended over this tool, but deletion can be useful if you
specifically to completely delete an account created for testing.
This will:

* Delete the user's account, including metadata like name, email
  address, custom profile fields, historical subscriptions, etc.

* Delete any messages they've sent and any non-group direct messages
  they've received.

* Group direct messages in which the user participated won't be
  deleted (with the exceptions of those message the deleted user
  sent). An inactive, inaccessible dummy user account named "Deleted
  User <id>" is created to replace the deleted user as a recipient in
  group direct message conversations, in order to somewhat preserve
  their integrity.

* Delete other records of the user's activity, such as emoji reactions.

* Deactivate all bots owned by the user, without deleting them or
  their data.  If you want to delete the bots and the message
  sent/received by them, you can use the command on them individually.
