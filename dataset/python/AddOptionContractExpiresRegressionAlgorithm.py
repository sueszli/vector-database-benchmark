### <summary>
### We add an option contract using 'QCAlgorithm.AddOptionContract' and place a trade, the underlying
### gets deselected from the universe selection but should still be present since we manually added the option contract.
### Later we call 'QCAlgorithm.RemoveOptionContract' and expect both option and underlying to be removed.
