    This class implements the Haircut Sharpe Ratios and Profit Hurdles algorithms described in the following paper:
    `Campbell R. Harvey and Yan Liu, Backtesting, (Fall 2015). Journal of Portfolio Management,
    2015 <https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=2345489>`_; The code is based on the code provided by the authors of the paper.

    The Haircut Sharpe Ratios algorithm lets the user adjust the observed Sharpe Ratios to take multiple testing into account
    and calculate the corresponding haircuts. The haircut is the percentage difference between the original Sharpe ratio
    and the new Sharpe ratio.

    The Profit Hurdle algorithm lets the user calculate the required mean return for a strategy at a given level of
    significance, taking multiple testing into account.
