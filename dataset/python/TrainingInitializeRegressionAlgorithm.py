### <summary>
### This regression algorithm is expected to fail and verifies that a training event
### created in Initialize will get run AND it will cause the algorithm to fail if it
### exceeds the "algorithm-manager-time-loop-maximum" config value, which the regression
### test sets to 0.5 minutes.

        # have exactly one time, which will fire between the first data point and the next day at
        # midnight. So after the first data point, it will run this event and sleep long enough to
        # exceed the static max algorithm time loop time and begin to consume from the leaky bucket
        # the regression test sets the "algorithm-manager-time-loop-maximum" value to 30 seconds
