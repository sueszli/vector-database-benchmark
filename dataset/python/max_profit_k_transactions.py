'''
Max Profit With K Transactions

You are given an array of integers representing the prices of a single stock on various days
(each index in the array represents a different day).
You are also given an integer k, which represents the number of transactions you are allowed to make.
One transaction consists of buying the stock on a given day and selling it on another, later day.
Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make buying and selling the stock,
given k transactions. Note that you can only hold 1 share of the stock at a time; in other words,
you cannot buy more than 1 share of the stock on any given day, and you cannot buy a share of the
stock if you are still holding another share.
In a day, you can first sell a share and buy another after that.

Input: [5, 11, 3, 50, 60, 90], 2
Output: 93
Output explanation: Buy 5, Sell 11; Buy 3, Sell 90

=========================================
Optimized dynamic programming solution.
For this solution you'll need only the current and previous rows.
The original (not optimized) DP formula is: MAX(dp[t][d-1], price[d] + MAX(dp[t-1][x] - price[x])),
but this is O(K * N^2) Time Complexity, and O(N * K) space complexity.
    Time Complexity:    O(N * Ðš)
    Space Complexity:   O(N)

            dp[curr_idx][d] = max(dp[curr_idx][d - 1], max_prev + prices[d])
