This script could split a dataset of csv to 2 parts. The odd columns, e.g. 1th, 3th, 5th, ...
would be split to one file and the even, e.g. 2th, 4th, 6th, ... would be split to another
This script is for Vertical Federated Learning functionality test, we could split the data
into two parts and mock the 2 client (parties) holding data of different features.
