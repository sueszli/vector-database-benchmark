    An interface to incrementally build an SArray element by element.

    Once closed, the SArray cannot be "reopened" using this interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : type
        The type of the elements in the SArray.

    num_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments that can be written in parallel.

    history_size : int, optional
        The number of elements to be cached as history. Caches the last
        `history_size` elements added with `append` or `append_multiple`.

    Returns
    -------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from turicreate import SArrayBuilder

    >>> sb = SArrayBuilder(int)

    >>> sb.append(1)

    >>> sb.append_multiple([2,3])
