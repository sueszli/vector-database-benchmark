class SFrameBuilder(object):
    """
    An interface to incrementally build an SFrame (row by row). It has some
    basic features such as appending multiple rows at once, polling the last N
    rows appended, and a primitive parallel insert interface.

    Once closed, the SFrame cannot be "reopened" using this interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    column_types : list[type]
        The column types of the result SFrame. Types must be of the python
        types that are supported by SFrame (int, float, str, array.array, list,
        dict, datetime.datetime, image). Column types are strictly enforced
        while appending.

    column_names : list[str], optional
        Column names of the result SFrame. If given, length of the list must
        equal the length of `column_types`. If not given, names are generated.

    num_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments that can be written in parallel.

    history_size : int, optional
        The number of rows to be cached as history. Caches the last
        `history_size` rows added with `append` or `append_multiple`.

    Returns
    -------
    out : SFrameBuilder

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from turicreate import SFrameBuilder

    >>> sb = SFrameBuilder([int,float,str])

    >>> sb.append([1,1.0,"1"])

    >>> sb.append_multiple([[2,2.0,"2"],[3,3.0,"3"]])

    >>> new_sf = sb.close(); new_sf

            X1      int
            X2      float
            X3      str
