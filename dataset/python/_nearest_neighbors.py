    Create a nearest neighbor model, which can be searched efficiently and
    quickly for the nearest neighbors of a query observation. If the `method`
    argument is specified as `auto`, the type of model is chosen automatically
    based on the type of data in `dataset`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : SFrame
        Reference data. If the features for each observation are numeric, they
        may be in separate columns of 'dataset' or a single column with lists
        of values. The features may also be in the form of a column of sparse
        vectors (i.e. dictionaries), with string keys and numeric values.

    label : string, optional
        Name of the SFrame column with row labels. If 'label' is not specified,
        row numbers are used to identify reference dataset rows when the model
        is queried.

    features : list[string], optional
        Name of the columns with features to use in computing distances between
        observations and the query points. 'None' (the default) indicates that
        all columns except the label should be used as features. Each column
        can be one of the following types:

        - *Numeric*: values of numeric type integer or float.

        - *Array*: list of numeric (integer or float) values. Each list element
          is treated as a separate variable in the model.

        - *Dictionary*: key-value pairs with numeric (integer or float) values.
          Each key indicates a separate variable in the model.

        - *List*: list of integer or string values. Each element is treated as
          a separate variable in the model.

        - *String*: string values.

        Please note: if a composite distance is also specified, this parameter
        is ignored.

    distance : string, function, or list[list], optional
        Function to measure the distance between any two input data rows. This
        may be one of three types:

        - *String*: the name of a standard distance function. One of
          'euclidean', 'squared_euclidean', 'manhattan', 'levenshtein',
          'jaccard', 'weighted_jaccard', 'cosine' or 'transformed_dot_product'.

        - *Function*: a function handle from the
          :mod:`~turicreate.toolkits.distances` module.

        - *Composite distance*: the weighted sum of several standard distance
          functions applied to various features. This is specified as a list of
          distance components, each of which is itself a list containing three
          items:

          1. list or tuple of feature names (strings)

          2. standard distance name (string)

          3. scaling factor (int or float)

        For more information about Turi Create distance functions, please
        see the :py:mod:`~turicreate.toolkits.distances` module.

        If 'distance' is left unspecified or set to 'auto', a composite
        distance is constructed automatically based on feature types.

    method : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'brute_force', 'lsh'}, optional
        Method for computing nearest neighbors. The options are:

        - *auto* (default): the method is chosen automatically, based on the
          type of data and the distance. If the distance is 'manhattan' or
          'euclidean' and the features are numeric or vectors of numeric
          values, then the 'ball_tree' method is used. Otherwise, the
          'brute_force' method is used.

        - *ball_tree*: use a tree structure to find the k-closest neighbors to
          each query point. The ball tree model is slower to construct than the
          brute force model, but queries are faster than linear time. This
          method is not applicable for the cosine  or transformed_dot_product
          distances.
          See `Liu, et al (2004)
          <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2666-an-investigation-of-p
          ractical-approximat e-nearest-neighbor-algorithms>`_ for
          implementation details.

        - *brute_force*: compute the distance from a query point to all
          reference observations. There is no computation time for model
          creation with the brute force method (although the reference data is
          held in the model, but each query takes linear time.

        - *lsh*: use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find approximate
          nearest neighbors efficiently. The LSH model supports 'euclidean',
          'squared_euclidean', 'manhattan', 'cosine', 'jaccard', and
          'transformed_dot_product' distances. Two options are provided for
          LSH -- ``num_tables`` and ``num_projections_per_table``. See the
          notes below for details.

    verbose: bool, optional
        If True, print progress updates and model details.

    **kwargs : optional
        Options for the distance function and query method.

        - *leaf_size*: for the ball tree method, the number of points in each
          leaf of the tree. The default is to use the max of 1,000 and
          n/(2^11), which ensures a maximum tree depth of 12.

        - *num_tables*: For the LSH method, the number of hash tables
          constructed. The default value is 20. We recommend choosing values
          from 10 to 30.

        - *num_projections_per_table*: For the LSH method, the number of
          projections/hash functions for each hash table. The default value is
          4 for 'jaccard' distance, 16 for 'cosine' distance and 8 for other
          distances. We recommend using number 2 ~ 6 for 'jaccard' distance, 8
          ~ 20 for 'cosine' distance and 4 ~ 12 for other distances.

    Returns
    -------
    out : NearestNeighborsModel
        A structure for efficiently computing the nearest neighbors in 'dataset'
        of new query points.

    See Also
    --------
    NearestNeighborsModel.query, turicreate.toolkits.distances

    Notes
    -----
    - Missing data is not allowed in the 'dataset' provided to this function.
      Please use the :func:`turicreate.SFrame.fillna` and
      :func:`turicreate.SFrame.dropna` utilities to handle missing data before
      creating a nearest neighbors model.

    - Missing keys in sparse vectors are assumed to have value 0.

    - If the features should be weighted equally in the distance calculations
      but are measured on different scales, it is important to standardize the
      features. One way to do this is to subtract the mean of each column and
      divide by the standard deviation.

    **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**

    There are several efficient nearest neighbors search algorithms that work
    well for data with low dimensions :math:`d` (approximately 50). However,
    most of the solutions suffer from either space or query time that is
    exponential in :math:`d`. For large :math:`d`, they often provide little,
    if any, improvement over the 'brute_force' method. This is a well-known
    consequence of the phenomenon called `The Curse of Dimensionality`.

    `Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing>`_ is an approach
    that is designed to efficiently solve the *approximate* nearest neighbor
    search problem for high dimensional data. The key idea of LSH is to hash
    the data points using several hash functions, so that the probability of
    collision is much higher for data points which are close to each other than
    those which are far apart.

    An LSH family is a family of functions :math:`h` which map points from the
    metric space to a bucket, so that

    - if :math:`d(p, q) \\leq R`, then :math:`h(p) = h(q)` with at least probability :math:`p_1`.
    - if :math:`d(p, q) \\geq cR`, then :math:`h(p) = h(q)` with probability at most :math:`p_2`.

    LSH for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search:

    - We define a new family of hash functions :math:`g`, where each
      function :math:`g` is obtained by concatenating :math:`k` functions
      :math:`h_1, ..., h_k`, i.e., :math:`g(p)=[h_1(p),...,h_k(p)]`.
      The algorithm constructs :math:`L` hash tables, each of which
      corresponds to a different randomly chosen hash function :math:`g`.
      There are :math:`k \\cdot L` hash functions used in total.

    - In the preprocessing step, we hash all :math:`n` reference points
      into each of the :math:`L` hash tables.

    - Given a query point :math:`q`, the algorithm iterates over the
      :math:`L` hash functions :math:`g`. For each :math:`g` considered, it
      retrieves the data points that are hashed into the same bucket as q.
      These data points from all the :math:`L` hash tables are considered as
      candidates that are then re-ranked by their real distances with the query
      data.

    **Note** that the number of tables :math:`L` and the number of hash
    functions per table :math:`k` are two main parameters. They can be set
    using the options ``num_tables`` and ``num_projections_per_table``
    respectively.

    Hash functions for different distances:

    - `euclidean` and `squared_euclidean`:
      :math:`h(q) = \\lfloor \\frac{a \\cdot q + b}{w} \\rfloor` where
      :math:`a` is a vector, of which the elements are independently
      sampled from normal distribution, and :math:`b` is a number
      uniformly sampled from :math:`[0, r]`. :math:`r` is a parameter for the
      bucket width. We set :math:`r` using the average all-pair `euclidean`
      distances from a small randomly sampled subset of the reference data.

    - `manhattan`: The hash function of `manhattan` is similar with that of
      `euclidean`. The only difference is that the elements of `a` are sampled
      from Cauchy distribution, instead of normal distribution.

    - `cosine`: Random Projection is designed to approximate the cosine
      distance between vectors. The hash function is :math:`h(q) = sgn(a \\cdot
      q)`, where :math:`a` is randomly sampled normal unit vector.

    - `jaccard`: We use a recently proposed method one permutation hashing by
      Shrivastava and Li. See the paper `[Shrivastava and Li, UAI 2014]
      <http://www.auai.org/uai2014/proceedings/individuals/225.pdf>`_ for
      details.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct a nearest neighbors model with automatically determined method
    and distance:

    >>> sf = turicreate.SFrame({'X1': [0.98, 0.62, 0.11],
    ...                       'X2': [0.69, 0.58, 0.36],
    ...                       'str_feature': ['cat', 'dog', 'fossa']})
    >>> model = turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['X1', 'X2'])

    For datasets with a large number of rows and up to about 100 variables, the
    ball tree method often leads to much faster queries.

    >>> model = turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['X1', 'X2'],
    ...                                           method='ball_tree')

    Often the final determination of a neighbor is based on several distance
    computations over different sets of features. Each part of this composite
    distance may have a different relative weight.

    >>> my_dist = [[['X1', 'X2'], 'euclidean', 2.],
    ...            [['str_feature'], 'levenshtein', 3.]]
    ...
    >>> model = turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, distance=my_dist)

        For each row of the input 'dataset', retrieve the nearest neighbors

        it is, the 'include_self_edges' parameter can be set to False to
        exclude results that match query points to themselves.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : SFrame
            Query data. Must contain columns with the same names and types as
            the features used to train the model. Additional columns are
            allowed, but ignored. Please see the nearest neighbors
            :func:`~turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create` documentation for more
            detail on allowable data types.

        label : str, optional
            Name of the query SFrame column with row labels. If 'label' is not
            specified, row numbers are used to identify query dataset rows in
            the output SFrame.

        k : int, optional
            Number of nearest neighbors to return from the reference set for
            each query observation. The default is 5 neighbors, but setting it
            to ``None`` will return all neighbors within ``radius`` of the
            query point.

        radius : float, optional
            Only neighbors whose distance to a query point is smaller than this
            value are returned. The default is ``None``, in which case the
            ``k`` nearest neighbors are returned for each query point,
            regardless of distance.

        verbose: bool, optional
            If True, print progress updates and model details.

        Returns
        -------
        out : SFrame
            An SFrame with the k-nearest neighbors of each query observation.
            The result contains four columns: the first is the label of the
            query observation, the second is the label of the nearby reference
            observation, the third is the distance between the query and
            reference observations, and the fourth is the rank of the reference
            observation among the query's k-nearest neighbors.

        See Also
        --------
        similarity_graph

        Notes
        -----
        - The `dataset` input to this method *can* have missing values (in
          contrast to the reference dataset used to create the nearest
          neighbors model). Missing numeric values are imputed to be the mean
          of the corresponding feature in the reference dataset, and missing
          strings are imputed to be empty strings.

        - If both ``k`` and ``radius`` are set to ``None``, each query point
          returns all of the reference set. If the reference dataset has
          :math:`n` rows and the query dataset has :math:`m` rows, the output
          is an SFrame with :math:`nm` rows.

        - For models created with the 'lsh' method, the query results may have
          fewer query labels than input query points. Because LSH is an
          approximate method, a query point may have fewer than 'k' neighbors.
          If LSH returns no neighbors at all for a query, the query point is
          omitted from the results.

        Examples
        --------
        First construct a toy SFrame and create a nearest neighbors model:

        >>> sf = turicreate.SFrame({'label': range(3),
        ...                       'feature1': [0.98, 0.62, 0.11],
        ...                       'feature2': [0.69, 0.58, 0.36]})
        >>> model = turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, 'label')

        A new SFrame contains query observations with same schema as the
        reference SFrame. This SFrame is passed to the ``query`` method.

        >>> queries = turicreate.SFrame({'label': range(3),
        ...                            'feature1': [0.05, 0.61, 0.99],
        ...                            'feature2': [0.06, 0.97, 0.86]})

            distance.

        include_self_edges : bool, optional
            For most distance functions, each point in the model's reference
            dataset is its own nearest neighbor. If this parameter is set to
            False, this result is ignored, and the nearest neighbors are
            returned *excluding* the point itself.

        output_type : {'SGraph', 'SFrame'}, optional
            By default, the results are returned in the form of an SGraph,
            where each point in the reference dataset is a vertex and an edge A
            -> B indicates that vertex B is a nearest neighbor of vertex A. If
            'output_type' is set to 'SFrame', the output is in the same form as
            the results of the 'query' method: an SFrame with columns
            indicating the query label (in this case the query data is the same
            as the reference data), reference label, distance between the two
            points, and the rank of the neighbor.

        verbose : bool, optional
            If True, print progress updates and model details.

        Returns
        -------
        out : SFrame or SGraph
            The type of the output object depends on the 'output_type'
            parameter. See the parameter description for more detail.

        Notes
        -----
        - If both ``k`` and ``radius`` are set to ``None``, each data point is
          matched to the entire dataset. If the reference dataset has
          :math:`n` rows, the output is an SFrame with :math:`n^2` rows (or an
          SGraph with :math:`n^2` edges).

        - For models created with the 'lsh' method, the output similarity graph
          may have fewer vertices than there are data points in the original
          reference set. Because LSH is an approximate method, a query point
          may have fewer than 'k' neighbors. If LSH returns no neighbors at all
          for a query and self-edges are excluded, the query point is omitted
          from the results.

        Examples
        --------
        First construct an SFrame and create a nearest neighbors model:

        >>> sf = turicreate.SFrame({'x1': [0.98, 0.62, 0.11],
        ...                       'x2': [0.69, 0.58, 0.36]})
        ...
        >>> model = turicreate.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, distance='euclidean')

        Unlike the ``query`` method, there is no need for a second dataset with
        ``similarity_graph``.

        >>> g = model.similarity_graph(k=1)  # an SGraph
        >>> g.edges
