    MDI Feature importance

    Mean decrease impurity (MDI) is a fast, explanatory-importance (in-sample, IS) method specific to tree-based
    classifiers, like RF. At each node of each decision tree, the selected feature splits the subset it received in
    such a way that impurity is decreased. Therefore, we can derive for each decision tree how much of the overall
    impurity decrease can be assigned to each feature. And given that we have a forest of trees, we can average those
    values across all estimators and rank the features accordingly.

    Tip:
    Masking effects take place when some features are systematically ignored by tree-based classifiers in favor of
    others. In order to avoid them, set max_features=int(1) when using sklearn’s RF class. In this way, only one random
    feature is considered per level.

    Notes:

    * MDI cannot be generalized to other non-tree based classifiers
    * The procedure is obviously in-sample.
    * Every feature will have some importance, even if they have no predictive power whatsoever.
    * MDI has the nice property that feature importances add up to 1, and every feature importance is bounded between 0 and 1.
    * method does not address substitution effects in the presence of correlated features. MDI dilutes the importance of
      substitute features, because of their interchangeability: The importance of two identical features will be halved,
      as they are randomly chosen with equal probability.
    * Sklearn’s RandomForest class implements MDI as the default feature importance score. This choice is likely
      motivated by the ability to compute MDI on the fly, with minimum computational cost.

    MDA Feature Importance

    Mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is a slow, predictive-importance (out-of-sample, OOS) method. First, it fits a
    classifier; second, it derives its performance OOS according to some performance score (accuracy, negative log-loss,
    etc.); third, it permutates each column of the features matrix (X), one column at a time, deriving the performance
    OOS after each column’s permutation. The importance of a feature is a function of the loss in performance caused by
    its column’s permutation. Some relevant considerations include:

    * This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
    * MDA is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score. For example, in the context of meta-labeling
      applications, we may prefer to score a classifier with F1 rather than accuracy. That is one reason a better
      descriptive name would have been “permutation importance.” When the scoring function does not correspond to a
      metric space, MDA results should be used as a ranking.
    * Like MDI, the procedure is also susceptible to substitution effects in the presence of correlated features.
      Given two identical features, MDA always considers one to be redundant to the other. Unfortunately, MDA will make
      both features appear to be outright irrelevant, even if they are critical.
    * Unlike MDI, it is possible that MDA concludes that all features are unimportant. That is because MDA is based on
      OOS performance.
    * The CV must be purged and embargoed.

    Implementation of SFI

    Substitution effects can lead us to discard important features that happen to be redundant. This is not generally a
    problem in the context of prediction, but it could lead us to wrong conclusions when we are trying to understand,
    improve, or simplify a model. For this reason, the following single feature importance method can be a good
    complement to MDI and MDA.

    Single feature importance (SFI) is a cross-section predictive-importance (out-of- sample) method. It computes the
    OOS performance score of each feature in isolation. A few considerations:

    * This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
    * SFI is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score.
    * Unlike MDI and MDA, no substitution effects take place, since only one feature is taken into consideration at a time.
    * Like MDA, it can conclude that all features are unimportant, because performance is evaluated via OOS CV.

    The main limitation of SFI is that a classifier with two features can perform better than the bagging of two
    single-feature classifiers. For example, (1) feature B may be useful only in combination with feature A;
    or (2) feature B may be useful in explaining the splits from feature A, even if feature B alone is inaccurate.
    In other words, joint effects and hierarchical importance are lost in SFI. One alternative would be to compute the
    OOS performance score from subsets of features, but that calculation will become intractable as more features are
    considered.
