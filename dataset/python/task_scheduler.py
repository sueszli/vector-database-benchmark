    """
    This is a simple task sheduler aimed at resumable tasks: usually we use `run_in_background`
    to launch a background task, or Twisted `deferLater` if we want to do so later on.

    The problem with that is that the tasks will just stop and never be resumed if synapse
    is stopped for whatever reason.

    How this works:
    - A function mapped to a named action should first be registered with `register_action`.
    This function will be called when trying to resuming tasks after a synapse shutdown,
    so this registration should happen when synapse is initialised, NOT right before scheduling
    a task.
    - A task can then be launched using this named action with `schedule_task`. A `params` dict
    can be passed, and it will be available to the registered function when launched. This task
    can be launch either now-ish, or later on by giving a `timestamp` parameter.

    The function may call `update_task` at any time to update the `result` of the task,
    and this can be used to resume the task at a specific point and/or to convey a result to
    the code launching the task.
    You can also specify the `result` (and/or an `error`) when returning from the function.

    The reconciliation loop runs every minute, so this is not a precise scheduler.
    There is a limit of 10 concurrent tasks, so tasks may be delayed if the pool is already
    full. In this regard, please take great care that scheduled tasks can actually finished.
    For now there is no mechanism to stop a running task if it is stuck.

    Tasks will be run on the worker specified with `run_background_tasks_on` config,
    or the main one by default.
