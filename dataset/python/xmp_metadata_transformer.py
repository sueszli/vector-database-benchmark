A metadata stream may be attached to a document through the Metadata entry in the document catalogue
(see 7.7.2, “Document Catalog”). The metadata framework provides a date stamp for metadata expressed in
the framework. If this date stamp is equal to or later than the document modification date recorded in the
document information dictionary, the metadata stream shall be taken as authoritative. If, however, the
document modification date recorded in the document information dictionary is later than the metadata
stream’s date stamp, the document has likely been saved by a writer that is not aware of metadata streams. In
this case, information stored in the document information dictionary shall be taken to override any semantically
equivalent items in the metadata stream. In addition, PDF document components represented as a stream or
dictionary may have a Metadata entry (see Table 316).
