    # In a race condition situation when the task is done, but the wait_for coroutine is cancelled from the outside,
    # the task result is lost. This handler allows to gracefully close the object that requires it.
    # You have two possible ways how to close an object in that case:
    #
    #   1. You can use a `lost_task_result_handler` keyword argument to pass a custom handler to a specific
    #      wait_for() call;
    #
    #   2. You can override this top-level handler and add a generic code for closing the lost objects by type:
    #
    #        if isinstance(task_result, MyConnectionType):
    #            task_result.close
    #
    #      It may be useful to close objects that are created in some library outside the Tribler code
    #
    # The default handler behavior is to report the lost object to the log
