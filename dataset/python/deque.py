"""
A deque is similar to all of the other sequential data structures but
has some implementation details that are different from other sequences
like a list. This module highlights those differences and shows how
a deque can be used as a LIFO stack and a FIFO queue.

    # A list is identical to a vector where a new array is created when
    # there are too many elements in the old array, and the old array

    # involved with growing a list increases linearly. A deque is
    # identical to a doubly linked list whose nodes have a left pointer
    # and a right pointer. In order to grow the linked list, a new node
    # is created and added to the left, or the right, of the linked list.
    # The time complexity involved with growing a deque is constant.
