    """Storage

    NiceGUI offers a straightforward method for data persistence within your application. 
    It features three built-in storage types:

    - `app.storage.user`:
        Stored server-side, each dictionary is associated with a unique identifier held in a browser session cookie.
        Unique to each user, this storage is accessible across all their browser tabs.
        `app.storage.browser['id']` is used to identify the user.
    - `app.storage.general`:
        Also stored server-side, this dictionary provides a shared storage space accessible to all users.
    - `app.storage.browser`:
        Unlike the previous types, this dictionary is stored directly as the browser session cookie, shared among all browser tabs for the same user.
        However, `app.storage.user` is generally preferred due to its advantages in reducing data payload, enhancing security, and offering larger storage capacity.
        By default, NiceGUI holds a unique identifier for the browser session in `app.storage.browser['id']`.

    The user storage and browser storage are only available within `page builder functions </documentation/page>`_
    because they are accessing the underlying `Request` object from FastAPI.
    Additionally these two types require the `storage_secret` parameter in`ui.run()` to encrypt the browser session cookie.
