    Replace the aten training dropout pattern with a noop, intended for eval.

    For models with dropout torch ops (nn.Dropout, F.dropout), calling model.eval()
    effectively turns these dropout ops into noops. For exported models, however,
    this is not done automatically, since the aten dropout patterns previously generated
    for training remain in the graph. Here we rewrite these dropout patterns with noops
    to avoid incorrectly applying further dropout during eval.
