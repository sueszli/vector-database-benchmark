    Example
    -------

    .. code-block:: python

        import param

        app = AppStateWatcher()

        app.state.counter = 1


        @param.depends(app.param.state, watch=True)

        app.state.counter += 1

    This would print ``The counter was updated to 2``.

    The ``AppStateWatcher`` is built on top of Param, which is a framework like dataclass, attrs and
    Pydantic which additionally provides powerful and unique features for building reactive apps.

    Please note the ``AppStateWatcher`` is a singleton, i.e., only one instance is instantiated
