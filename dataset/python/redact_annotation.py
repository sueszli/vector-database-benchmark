"""
A redaction annotation (PDF 1.7) identifies content that is intended to be removed from the document. The
intent of redaction annotations is to enable the following process:

a) Content identification. A user applies redact annotations that specify the pieces or regions of content that
should be removed. Up until the next step is performed, the user can see, move and redefine these
annotations.

b) Content removal. The user instructs the viewer application to apply the redact annotations, after which the
content in the area specified by the redact annotations is removed. In the removed content’s place, some
marking appears to indicate the area has been redacted. Also, the redact annotations are removed from
the PDF document.

Redaction annotations provide a mechanism for the first step in the redaction process (content identification).
This allows content to be marked for redaction in a non-destructive way, thus enabling a review process for
evaluating potential redactions prior to removing the specified content.
