def load_audio(
    path, with_path=True, recursive=True, ignore_failure=True, random_order=False
):
    """
    Loads WAV file(s) from a path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Path to WAV files to be loaded.

    with_path : bool, optional
        Indicates whether a path column is added to the returned SFrame.

    recursive : bool, optional
        Indicates whether ``load_audio`` should do a recursive directory traversal,
        or only load audio files directly under ``path``.

    ignore_failure : bool, optional
        If True, only print warnings for failed files and keep loading the remaining
        audio files.

    random_order : bool, optional
        Load audio files in random order.

    Returns
    -------
    out : SFrame
        Returns an SFrame with either an 'audio' column or both an 'audio' and
        a 'path' column. The 'audio' column is a column of dictionaries.

        Each dictionary contains two items. One item is the sample rate, in
        samples per second (int type). The other item will be the data in a numpy
        array. If the wav file has a single channel, the array will have a single
        dimension. If there are multiple channels, the array will have shape
        (L,C) where L is the number of samples and C is the number of channels.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> audio_path = "~/Documents/myAudioFiles/"
    >>> audio_sframe = tc.audio_analysis.load_audio(audio_path, recursive=True)
