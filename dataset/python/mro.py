"""
MRO stands for method resolution order and it's used by class definitions
to determine which method will be run by a class instance. This module
shows how the MRO is useful for the classic diamond problem where classes
B and C depend on class A, and class D depends on classes B and C.

    This is what we call the diamond problem, where `BasePlayer` child classes
    are the same as `ConfusedPlayer` parent classes. Python has the MRO to
    determine which `ping` and `pong` methods are called via the `super()`
    call followed by the respective method.

    The `super()` call is usually used without any parameters, which
    means that we start the MRO process from the current class upwards.

    start the MRO process from another class. This is generally discouraged
