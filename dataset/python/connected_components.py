class ConnectedComponentsModel(_ModelBase):
    r"""
    A ConnectedComponentsModel object contains the component ID for each vertex
    and the total number of weakly connected components in the graph.

    A weakly connected component is a maximal set of vertices such that there
    exists an undirected path between any two vertices in the set.

    Below is a list of queryable fields for this model:

    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | Field          | Description                                         |
    +================+=====================================================+
    | graph          | A new SGraph with the color id as a vertex property |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | training_time  | Total training time of the model                    |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | component_size | An SFrame with the size of each component           |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | component_id   | An SFrame with each vertex's component id           |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

    This model cannot be constructed directly.  Instead, use
    :func:`turicreate.connected_components.create` to create an instance
    of this model. A detailed list of parameter options and code samples
    are available in the documentation for the create function.

    """
    Compute the number of weakly connected components in the graph. Return a
    model object with total number of weakly connected components as well as the
    component ID for each vertex in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : SGraph
        The graph on which to compute the triangle counts.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print progress updates.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ConnectedComponentsModel

    Examples
    --------
    If given an :class:`~turicreate.SGraph` ``g``, we can create
    a :class:`~turicreate.connected_components.ConnectedComponentsModel` as
    follows:

    >>> g = turicreate.load_sgraph('http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.txt.gz', format='snap')
    >>> cc = turicreate.connected_components.create(g)
    >>> cc.summary()

    We can obtain the ``component id`` corresponding to each vertex in the
    graph ``g`` as follows:

    >>> cc_ids = cc['component_id']  # SFrame

    We can obtain a graph with additional information about the ``component
    id`` corresponding to each vertex as follows:

    >>> cc_graph = cc['graph']      # SGraph

    We can add the new component_id field to the original graph g using:

    >>> g.vertices['component_id'] = cc['graph'].vertices['component_id']

    Note that the task above does not require a join because the vertex
    ordering is preserved through ``create()``.
