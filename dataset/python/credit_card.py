    """Credit card frauds.

    The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european
    cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492
    frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class
    (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

    It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
    Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more
    background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components
    obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and
    'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first
    transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be
    used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and
    it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
