    Description:
    The Relative Momentum Index was developed by Roger Altman and was
    introduced in his article in the February, 1993 issue of Technical Analysis
    of Stocks & Commodities magazine.

    While your typical RSI counts up and down days from close to close, the
    Relative Momentum Index counts up and down days from the close relative to
    a close x number of days ago. The result is an RSI that is a bit smoother.

    Usage:
    Use in the same way you would any other RSI . There are overbought and
    oversold zones, and can also be used for divergence and trend analysis.
