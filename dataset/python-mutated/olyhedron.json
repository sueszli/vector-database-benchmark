In fact, for a polyhedron,\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\n\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\n        |     |  1) through the face\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\n\n\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\n\n        A       B          A       B\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\n\n        original           after rotation\n                           along 1-4\n\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\n\n        >>> pgroup = []\n\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\n\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\n\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\n\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\n\n        The square can now be constructed:\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\n               camera order\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\n\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\n\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\n\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\n        >>> square.corners\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\n\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\n\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\n        >>> square.corners\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\n\n        Thinking outside the box\n        ------------------------\n\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\n        permutations to something physical. For example, a Rubik's cube is\n        not a proper polyhedron, but the Polyhedron class can be used to\n        represent it in a way that helps to visualize the Rubik's cube.\n\n        >>> from sympy import flatten, unflatten, symbols\n        >>> from sympy.combinatorics import RubikGroup\n        >>> facelets = flatten([symbols(s+'1:5') for s in 'UFRBLD'])\n        >>> def show():\n        ...     pairs = unflatten(r2.corners, 2)\n        ...     print(pairs[::2])\n        ...     print(pairs[1::2])\n        ...\n        >>> r2 = Polyhedron(facelets, pgroup=RubikGroup(2))\n        >>> show()\n        [(U1, U2), (F1, F2), (R1, R2), (B1, B2), (L1, L2), (D1, D2)]\n        [(U3, U4), (F3, F4), (R3, R4), (B3, B4), (L3, L4), (D3, D4)]\n        >>> r2.rotate(0) # cw rotation of F\n        >>> show()\n        [(U1, U2), (F3, F1), (U3, R2), (B1, B2), (L1, D1), (R3, R1)]\n        [(L4, L2), (F4, F2), (U4, R4), (B3, B4), (L3, D2), (D3, D4)]\n\n        Predefined Polyhedra\n        ====================\n\n        For convenience, the vertices and faces are defined for the following\n        standard solids along with a permutation group for transformations.\n        When the polyhedron is oriented as indicated below, the vertices in\n        a given horizontal plane are numbered in ccw direction, starting from\n        the vertex that will give the lowest indices in a given face.

In fact, for a polyhedron,\\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\\n\\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\\n\\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\\n        |     |  1) through the face\\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\\n\\n\\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\\n\\n        A       B          A       B\\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\\n\\n        original           after rotation\\n                           along 1-4\\n\\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = []\\n\\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\\n\\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\\n\\n        The square can now be constructed:\\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\\n               camera order\\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\\n\\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\\n\\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\\n\\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\\n\\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\\n\\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\\n\\n        Thinking outside the box\\n        ------------------------\\n\\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\\n        permutations to something physical.

In fact, for a polyhedron,\\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\\n\\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\\n\\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\\n        |     |  1) through the face\\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\\n\\n\\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\\n\\n        A       B          A       B\\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\\n\\n        original           after rotation\\n                           along 1-4\\n\\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = []\\n\\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\\n\\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\\n\\n        The square can now be constructed:\\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\\n               camera order\\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\\n\\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\\n\\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\\n\\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\\n\\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\\n\\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\\n\\n        Thinking outside the box\\n        ------------------------\\n\\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\\n        permutations to something physical.

(The identity\\n        permutation, Permutation(range(4)), is not included since it does\\n        not change the orientation of the vertices.)\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = [Permutation([[0, 1, 2], [3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 1, 3], [2]]),                       Permutation([[0, 2, 3], [1]]),                       Permutation([[1, 2, 3], [0]]),                       Permutation([[0, 1], [2, 3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 2], [1, 3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 3], [1, 2]])]\\n\\n        The Polyhedron is now constructed and demonstrated:\\n\\n        >>> tetra = Polyhedron(corners, faces, pgroup)\\n        >>> tetra.size\\n        4\\n        >>> tetra.edges\\n        {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (w, x, y, z)\\n\\n        It can be rotated with an arbitrary permutation of vertices, e.g.\\n        the following permutation is not in the pgroup:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.rotate(Permutation([0, 1, 3, 2]))\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (w, x, z, y)\\n\\n        An allowed permutation of the vertices can be constructed by\\n        repeatedly applying permutations from the pgroup to the vertices.\\n        Here is a demonstration that applying p and p**2 for every p in\\n        pgroup generates all the orientations of a tetrahedron and no others:\\n\\n        >>> all = ( (w, x, y, z),                     (x, y, w, z),                     (y, w, x, z),                     (w, z, x, y),                     (z, w, y, x),                     (w, y, z, x),                     (y, z, w, x),                     (x, z, y, w),                     (z, y, x, w),                     (y, x, z, w),                     (x, w, z, y),                     (z, x, w, y) )\\n\\n        >>> got = []\\n        >>> for p in (pgroup + [p**2 for p in pgroup]):\\n        ...     h = Polyhedron(corners)\\n        ...     h.rotate(p)\\n        ...     got.append(h.corners)\\n        ...\\n        >>> set(got) == set(all)\\n        True\\n\\n        The make_perm method of a PermutationGroup will randomly pick\\n        permutations, multiply them together, and return the permutation that\\n        can be applied to the polyhedron to give the orientation produced\\n        by those individual permutations.\\n\\n        Here, 3 permutations are used:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.pgroup.make_perm(3) # doctest: +SKIP\\n        Permutation([0, 3, 1, 2])\\n\\n        To select the permutations that should be used, supply a list\\n        of indices to the permutations in pgroup in the order they should\\n        be applied:\\n\\n        >>> use = [0, 0, 2]\\n        >>> p002 = tetra.pgroup.make_perm(3, use)\\n        >>> p002\\n        Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\\n\\n\\n        Apply them one at a time:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.reset()\\n        >>> for i in use:\\n        ...     tetra.rotate(pgroup[i])\\n        ...\\n        >>> tetra.vertices\\n        (x, w, z, y)\\n        >>> sequentially = tetra.vertices\\n\\n        Apply the composite permutation:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.reset()\\n        >>> tetra.rotate(p002)\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (x, w, z, y)\\n        >>> tetra.corners in all and tetra.corners == sequentially\\n        True\\n\\n        Notes\\n        =====\\n\\n        Defining permutation groups\\n        ---------------------------\\n\\n        It is not necessary to enter any permutations, nor is necessary to\\n        enter a complete set of transformations. In fact, for a polyhedron,\\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\\n\\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\\n\\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\\n        |     |  1) through the face\\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\\n\\n\\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\\n\\n        A       B          A       B\\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\\n\\n        original           after rotation\\n                           along 1-4\\n\\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = []\\n\\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\\n\\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\\n\\n        The square can now be constructed:\\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\\n               camera order\\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\\n\\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\\n\\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\\n\\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\\n\\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\\n\\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\\n\\n        Thinking outside the box\\n        ------------------------\\n\\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\\n        permutations to something physical.

In fact, for a polyhedron,\\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\\n\\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\\n\\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\\n        |     |  1) through the face\\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\\n\\n\\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\\n\\n        A       B          A       B\\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\\n\\n        original           after rotation\\n                           along 1-4\\n\\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = []\\n\\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\\n\\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\\n\\n        The square can now be constructed:\\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\\n               camera order\\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\\n\\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\\n\\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\\n\\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\\n\\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\\n\\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\\n\\n        Thinking outside the box\\n        ------------------------\\n\\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\\n        permutations to something physical.

(The identity\\n        permutation, Permutation(range(4)), is not included since it does\\n        not change the orientation of the vertices.)\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = [Permutation([[0, 1, 2], [3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 1, 3], [2]]),                       Permutation([[0, 2, 3], [1]]),                       Permutation([[1, 2, 3], [0]]),                       Permutation([[0, 1], [2, 3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 2], [1, 3]]),                       Permutation([[0, 3], [1, 2]])]\\n\\n        The Polyhedron is now constructed and demonstrated:\\n\\n        >>> tetra = Polyhedron(corners, faces, pgroup)\\n        >>> tetra.size\\n        4\\n        >>> tetra.edges\\n        {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (w, x, y, z)\\n\\n        It can be rotated with an arbitrary permutation of vertices, e.g.\\n        the following permutation is not in the pgroup:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.rotate(Permutation([0, 1, 3, 2]))\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (w, x, z, y)\\n\\n        An allowed permutation of the vertices can be constructed by\\n        repeatedly applying permutations from the pgroup to the vertices.\\n        Here is a demonstration that applying p and p**2 for every p in\\n        pgroup generates all the orientations of a tetrahedron and no others:\\n\\n        >>> all = ( (w, x, y, z),                     (x, y, w, z),                     (y, w, x, z),                     (w, z, x, y),                     (z, w, y, x),                     (w, y, z, x),                     (y, z, w, x),                     (x, z, y, w),                     (z, y, x, w),                     (y, x, z, w),                     (x, w, z, y),                     (z, x, w, y) )\\n\\n        >>> got = []\\n        >>> for p in (pgroup + [p**2 for p in pgroup]):\\n        ...     h = Polyhedron(corners)\\n        ...     h.rotate(p)\\n        ...     got.append(h.corners)\\n        ...\\n        >>> set(got) == set(all)\\n        True\\n\\n        The make_perm method of a PermutationGroup will randomly pick\\n        permutations, multiply them together, and return the permutation that\\n        can be applied to the polyhedron to give the orientation produced\\n        by those individual permutations.\\n\\n        Here, 3 permutations are used:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.pgroup.make_perm(3) # doctest: +SKIP\\n        Permutation([0, 3, 1, 2])\\n\\n        To select the permutations that should be used, supply a list\\n        of indices to the permutations in pgroup in the order they should\\n        be applied:\\n\\n        >>> use = [0, 0, 2]\\n        >>> p002 = tetra.pgroup.make_perm(3, use)\\n        >>> p002\\n        Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\\n\\n\\n        Apply them one at a time:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.reset()\\n        >>> for i in use:\\n        ...     tetra.rotate(pgroup[i])\\n        ...\\n        >>> tetra.vertices\\n        (x, w, z, y)\\n        >>> sequentially = tetra.vertices\\n\\n        Apply the composite permutation:\\n\\n        >>> tetra.reset()\\n        >>> tetra.rotate(p002)\\n        >>> tetra.corners\\n        (x, w, z, y)\\n        >>> tetra.corners in all and tetra.corners == sequentially\\n        True\\n\\n        Notes\\n        =====\\n\\n        Defining permutation groups\\n        ---------------------------\\n\\n        It is not necessary to enter any permutations, nor is necessary to\\n        enter a complete set of transformations. In fact, for a polyhedron,\\n        all configurations can be constructed from just two permutations.\\n        For example, the orientations of a tetrahedron can be generated from\\n        an axis passing through a vertex and face and another axis passing\\n        through a different vertex or from an axis passing through the\\n        midpoints of two edges opposite of each other.\\n\\n        For simplicity of presentation, consider a square --\\n        not a cube -- with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4:\\n\\n        1-----2  We could think of axes of rotation being:\\n        |     |  1) through the face\\n        |     |  2) from midpoint 1-2 to 3-4 or 1-3 to 2-4\\n        3-----4  3) lines 1-4 or 2-3\\n\\n\\n        To determine how to write the permutations, imagine 4 cameras,\\n        one at each corner, labeled A-D:\\n\\n        A       B          A       B\\n         1-----2            1-----3             vertex index:\\n         |     |            |     |                 1   0\\n         |     |            |     |                 2   1\\n         3-----4            2-----4                 3   2\\n        C       D          C       D                4   3\\n\\n        original           after rotation\\n                           along 1-4\\n\\n        A diagonal and a face axis will be chosen for the \"permutation group\"\\n        from which any orientation can be constructed.\\n\\n        >>> pgroup = []\\n\\n        Imagine a clockwise rotation when viewing 1-4 from camera A. The new\\n        orientation is (in camera-order): 1, 3, 2, 4 so the permutation is\\n        given using the *indices* of the vertices as:\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((0, 2, 1, 3)))\\n\\n        Now imagine rotating clockwise when looking down an axis entering the\\n        center of the square as viewed. The new camera-order would be\\n        3, 1, 4, 2 so the permutation is (using indices):\\n\\n        >>> pgroup.append(Permutation((2, 0, 3, 1)))\\n\\n        The square can now be constructed:\\n            ** use real-world labels for the vertices, entering them in\\n               camera order\\n            ** for the faces we use zero-based indices of the vertices\\n               in *edge-order* as the face is traversed; neither the\\n               direction nor the starting point matter -- the faces are\\n               only used to define edges (if so desired).\\n\\n        >>> square = Polyhedron((1, 2, 3, 4), [(0, 1, 3, 2)], pgroup)\\n\\n        To rotate the square with a single permutation we can do:\\n\\n        >>> square.rotate(square.pgroup[0])\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (1, 3, 2, 4)\\n\\n        To use more than one permutation (or to use one permutation more\\n        than once) it is more convenient to use the make_perm method:\\n\\n        >>> p011 = square.pgroup.make_perm([0, 1, 1]) # diag flip + 2 rotations\\n        >>> square.reset() # return to initial orientation\\n        >>> square.rotate(p011)\\n        >>> square.corners\\n        (4, 2, 3, 1)\\n\\n        Thinking outside the box\\n        ------------------------\\n\\n        Although the Polyhedron object has a direct physical meaning, it\\n        actually has broader application. In the most general sense it is\\n        just a decorated PermutationGroup, allowing one to connect the\\n        permutations to something physical. For example, a Rubik\\'s cube is\\n        not a proper polyhedron, but the Polyhedron class can be used to\\n        represent it in a way that helps to visualize the Rubik\\'s cube.\\n\\n        >>> from sympy import flatten, unflatten, symbols\\n        >>> from sympy.combinatorics import RubikGroup\\n        >>> facelets = flatten([symbols(s+\\'1:5\\') for s in \\'UFRBLD\\'])\\n        >>> def show():\\n        ...     pairs = unflatten(r2.corners, 2)\\n        ...     print(pairs[::2])\\n        ...     print(pairs[1::2])\\n        ...\\n        >>> r2 = Polyhedron(facelets, pgroup=RubikGroup(2))\\n        >>> show()\\n        [(U1, U2), (F1, F2), (R1, R2), (B1, B2), (L1, L2), (D1, D2)]\\n        [(U3, U4), (F3, F4), (R3, R4), (B3, B4), (L3, L4), (D3, D4)]\\n        >>> r2.rotate(0) # cw rotation of F\\n        >>> show()\\n        [(U1, U2), (F3, F1), (U3, R2), (B1, B2), (L1, D1), (R3, R1)]\\n        [(L4, L2), (F4, F2), (U4, R4), (B3, B4), (L3, D2), (D3, D4)]\\n\\n        Predefined Polyhedra\\n        ====================\\n\\n        For convenience, the vertices and faces are defined for the following\\n        standard solids along with a permutation group for transformations.\\n        When the polyhedron is oriented as indicated below, the vertices in\\n        a given horizontal plane are numbered in ccw direction, starting from\\n        the vertex that will give the lowest indices in a given face.

A set of permutations is called a \"group\" if::\n\n    a*b = c (for any pair of permutations in the group, a and b, their\n    product, c, is in the group)\n\n    a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c (for any 3 permutations in the group associativity holds)\n\n    there is an identity permutation, I, such that I*a = a*I for all elements\n    in the group\n\n    a*b = I (the inverse of each permutation is also in the group)\n\n    None of the polyhedron groups defined follow these definitions of a group.\n    Instead, they are selected to contain those permutations whose powers\n    alone will construct all orientations of the polyhedron, i.e. for\n    permutations ``a``, ``b``, etc... in the group, ``a, a**2, ..., a**o_a``,\n    ``b, b**2, ..., b**o_b``, etc... (where ``o_i`` is the order of\n    permutation ``i``) generate all permutations of the polyhedron instead of\n    mixed products like ``a*b``, ``a*b**2``, etc....\n\n    Note that for a polyhedron with n vertices, the valid permutations of the\n    vertices exclude those that do not maintain its faces. e.g. the\n    permutation BCDE of a square's four corners, ABCD, is a valid\n    permutation while CBDE is not (because this would twist the square).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    The is_group checks for: closure, the presence of the Identity permutation,\n    and the presence of the inverse for each of the elements in the group. This\n    confirms that none of the polyhedra are true groups:\n\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.polyhedron import (\n    ... tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron)\n    ...\n    >>> polyhedra = (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron)\n    >>> [h.pgroup.is_group for h in polyhedra]\n    ...\n    [True, True, True, True, True]\n\n    Although tests in polyhedron's test suite check that powers of the\n    permutations in the groups generate all permutations of the vertices\n    of the polyhedron, here we also demonstrate the powers of the given\n    permutations create a complete group for the tetrahedron:\n\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics import Permutation, PermutationGroup\n    >>> for h in polyhedra[:1]:\n    ...     G = h.pgroup\n    ...     perms = set()\n    ...     for g in G:\n    ...         for e in range(g.order()):\n    ...             p = tuple((g**e).array_form)\n    ...             perms.add(p)\n    ...\n    ...     perms = [Permutation(p) for p in perms]\n    ...     assert PermutationGroup(perms).is_group\n\n    In addition to doing the above, the tests in the suite confirm that the\n    faces are all present after the application of each permutation.\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..
