    'Returns a lower bound on the diameter of the graph G.\n\n    The function computes a lower bound on the diameter (i.e., the maximum eccentricity)\n    of a directed or undirected graph G. The procedure used varies depending on the graph\n    being directed or not.\n\n    If G is an `undirected` graph, then the function uses the `2-sweep` algorithm [1]_.\n    The main idea is to pick the farthest node from a random node and return its eccentricity.\n\n    Otherwise, if G is a `directed` graph, the function uses the `2-dSweep` algorithm [2]_,\n    The procedure starts by selecting a random source node $s$ from which it performs a\n    forward and a backward BFS. Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be the farthest nodes in the forward and\n    backward cases, respectively. Then, it computes the backward eccentricity of $a_1$ using\n    a backward BFS and the forward eccentricity of $a_2$ using a forward BFS.\n    Finally, it returns the best lower bound between the two.\n\n    In both cases, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of G.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G : NetworkX graph\n\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    d : integer\n       Lower Bound on the Diameter of G\n\n    Raises\n    ------\n    NetworkXError\n        If the graph is empty or\n        If the graph is undirected and not connected or\n        If the graph is directed and not strongly connected.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    networkx.algorithms.distance_measures.diameter\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
