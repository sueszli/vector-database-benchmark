Bing has developed a web-based spell-checker that leverages\n        machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically\n        train a constantly evolving and highly contextual algorithm. The\n        spell-checker is based on a massive corpus of web searches and\n        documents.\n\n        :param text: The text string to check for spelling and grammar errors.\n         The combined length of the text string, preContextText string, and\n         postContextText string may not exceed 10,000 characters. You may\n         specify this parameter in the query string of a GET request or in the\n         body of a POST request. Because of the query string length limit,\n         you'll typically use a POST request unless you're checking only short\n         strings.\n        :type text: str\n        :param accept_language: A comma-delimited list of one or more\n         languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing\n         order of preference. For additional information, including expected\n         format, see\n         [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\n         This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do\n         not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc\n         query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds\n         from the list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value\n         to determine the market to return results for. If the list does not\n         include a supported language, Bing will find the closest language and\n         market that supports the request, and may use an aggregated or default\n         market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this\n         header and the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple\n         languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query\n         parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label\n         in a user interface. There are very few user interface strings in the\n         JSON response objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com\n         properties will apply the specified language.\n        :type accept_language: str\n        :param pragma: By default, Bing returns cached content, if available.\n         To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header\n         to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).\n        :type pragma: str\n        :param user_agent: The user agent originating the request. Bing uses\n         the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience.\n         Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this\n         header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly\n         used browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC\n         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\n        :type user_agent: str\n        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with\n         consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\n         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for\n         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same\n         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign\n         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\n        :type client_id: str\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\n        :type client_ip: str\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\n        :type location: str\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\n         load. The following are the possible values. 1) Edit\u2014The request is\n         from an interactive session 2) Load\u2014The request is from a page load.\n         Possible values include: 'Edit', 'Load'\n        :type action_type: str or\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck.models.ActionType\n        :param app_name: The unique name of your app. The name must be known\n         by Bing. Do not include this parameter unless you have previously\n         contacted Bing to get a unique app name. To get a unique name, contact\n         your Bing Business Development manager.\n        :type app_name: str\n        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where\n         the results come from. This API supports only the United States\n         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and\n         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\n        :type country_code: str\n        :param client_machine_name: A unique name of the device that the\n         request is being made from. Generate a unique value for each device\n         (the value is unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug\n         issues and improve the quality of corrections.\n        :type client_machine_name: str\n        :param doc_id: A unique ID that identifies the document that the text\n         belongs to. Generate a unique value for each document (the value is\n         unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\n         the quality of corrections.\n        :type doc_id: str\n        :param market: The market where the results come from. You are\n         strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying\n         the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and\n         optimal response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\n        :type market: str\n        :param session_id: A unique ID that identifies this user session.\n         Generate a unique value for each user session (the value is\n         unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\n         the quality of corrections\n        :type session_id: str\n        :param set_lang: The language to use for user interface strings.\n         Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For\n         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN\n         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.\n         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt\n         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a\n         different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header are\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both. A user interface string is a\n         string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user\n         interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to\n         Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified\n         language.\n        :type set_lang: str\n        :param user_id: A unique ID that identifies the user. Generate a\n         unique value for each user (the value is unimportant). The service\n         uses the ID to help debug issues and improve the quality of\n         corrections.\n        :type user_id: str\n        :param mode: The type of spelling and grammar checks to perform. The\n         following are the possible values (the values are case insensitive).\n         The default is Proof. 1) Proof\u2014Finds most spelling and grammar\n         mistakes. 2) Spell\u2014Finds most spelling mistakes but does not find some\n         of the grammar errors that Proof catches (for example, capitalization\n         and repeated words). Possible values include: 'proof', 'spell'\n        :type mode: str or\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck.models.Mode\n        :param pre_context_text: A string that gives context to the text\n         string. For example, the text string petal is valid. However, if you\n         set preContextText to bike, the context changes and the text string\n         becomes not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change\n         petal to pedal (as in bike pedal). This text is not checked for\n         grammar or spelling errors. The combined length of the text string,\n         preContextText string, and postContextText string may not exceed\n         10,000 characters. You may specify this parameter in the query string\n         of a GET request or in the body of a POST request.\n        :type pre_context_text: str\n        :param post_context_text: A string that gives context to the text\n         string. For example, the text string read is valid. However, if you\n         set postContextText to carpet, the context changes and the text string\n         becomes not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change read\n         to red (as in red carpet). This text is not checked for grammar or\n         spelling errors. The combined length of the text string,\n         preContextText string, and postContextText string may not exceed\n         10,000 characters.

Being assigned to multiple\\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\\n        :type client_id: str\\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\\n        :type client_ip: str\\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\\n        :type location: str\\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\\n         load. The following are the possible values. 1) Edit\u2014The request is\\n         from an interactive session 2) Load\u2014The request is from a page load.\\n         Possible values include: 'Edit', 'Load'\\n        :type action_type: str or\\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck.models.ActionType\\n        :param app_name: The unique name of your app. The name must be known\\n         by Bing. Do not include this parameter unless you have previously\\n         contacted Bing to get a unique app name. To get a unique name, contact\\n         your Bing Business Development manager.\\n        :type app_name: str\\n        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where\\n         the results come from. This API supports only the United States\\n         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If\\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and\\n         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\\n        :type country_code: str\\n        :param client_machine_name: A unique name of the device that the\\n         request is being made from. Generate a unique value for each device\\n         (the value is unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug\\n         issues and improve the quality of corrections.\\n        :type client_machine_name: str\\n        :param doc_id: A unique ID that identifies the document that the text\\n         belongs to. Generate a unique value for each document (the value is\\n         unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\\n         the quality of corrections.\\n        :type doc_id: str\\n        :param market: The market where the results come from. You are\\n         strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying\\n         the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and\\n         optimal response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are\\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\\n        :type market: str\\n        :param session_id: A unique ID that identifies this user session.\\n         Generate a unique value for each user session (the value is\\n         unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\\n         the quality of corrections\\n        :type session_id: str\\n        :param set_lang: The language to use for user interface strings.\\n         Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For\\n         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN\\n         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.\\n         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt\\n         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a\\n         different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header are\\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both. A user interface string is a\\n         string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user\\n         interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to\\n         Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified\\n         language.\\n        :type set_lang: str\\n        :param user_id: A unique ID that identifies the user.

The\\n         following are the possible values (the values are case insensitive).\\n         The default is Proof. 1) Proof\u2014Finds most spelling and grammar\\n         mistakes. 2) Spell\u2014Finds most spelling mistakes but does not find some\\n         of the grammar errors that Proof catches (for example, capitalization\\n         and repeated words). Possible values include: 'proof', 'spell'\\n        :type mode: str or\\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck.models.Mode\\n        :param pre_context_text: A string that gives context to the text\\n         string. For example, the text string petal is valid. However, if you\\n         set preContextText to bike, the context changes and the text string\\n         becomes not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change\\n         petal to pedal (as in bike pedal). This text is not checked for\\n         grammar or spelling errors. The combined length of the text string,\\n         preContextText string, and postContextText string may not exceed\\n         10,000 characters. You may specify this parameter in the query string\\n         of a GET request or in the body of a POST request.\\n        :type pre_context_text: str\\n        :param post_context_text: A string that gives context to the text\\n         string. For example, the text string read is valid. However, if you\\n         set postContextText to carpet, the context changes and the text string\\n         becomes not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change read\\n         to red (as in red carpet). This text is not checked for grammar or\\n         spelling errors.

Negative values\\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\\n        :type location: str\\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\\n         load.

This API supports only the United States\\n         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If\\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and\\n         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\\n        :type country_code: str\\n        :param client_machine_name: A unique name of the device that the\\n         request is being made from.

The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\\n         the quality of corrections.\\n        :type doc_id: str\\n        :param market: The market where the results come from. You are\\n         strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying\\n         the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and\\n         optimal response.

For\\n         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN\\n         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.\\n         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt\\n         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a\\n         different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header are\\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both. A user interface string is a\\n         string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user\\n         interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to\\n         Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified\\n         language.\\n        :type set_lang: str\\n        :param user_id: A unique ID that identifies the user.

For example, the text string petal is valid. However, if you\\n         set preContextText to bike, the context changes and the text string\\n         becomes not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change\\n         petal to pedal (as in bike pedal). This text is not checked for\\n         grammar or spelling errors. The combined length of the text string,\\n         preContextText string, and postContextText string may not exceed\\n         10,000 characters.

For information about user agents, see [RFC\\n         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\\n        :type user_agent: str\\n        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with\\n         consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\\n         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for\\n         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same\\n         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign\\n         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple\\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\\n        :type client_id: str\\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\\n        :type client_ip: str\\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\\n        :type location: str\\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\\n         load.

If\\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.

For information about user agents, see [RFC\\n         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\\n        :type user_agent: str\\n        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with\\n         consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\\n         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for\\n         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same\\n         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign\\n         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple\\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\\n        :type client_id: str\\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\\n        :type client_ip: str\\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\\n        :type location: str\\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\\n         load.

For additional information, including expected\\n         format, see\\n         [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\\n         This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do\\n         not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc\\n         query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds\\n         from the list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value\\n         to determine the market to return results for. If the list does not\\n         include a supported language, Bing will find the closest language and\\n         market that supports the request, and may use an aggregated or default\\n         market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this\\n         header and the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple\\n         languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query\\n         parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label\\n         in a user interface. There are very few user interface strings in the\\n         JSON response objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com\\n         properties will apply the specified language.\\n        :type accept_language: str\\n        :param pragma: By default, Bing returns cached content, if available.\\n         To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header\\n         to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).\\n        :type pragma: str\\n        :param user_agent: The user agent originating the request. Bing uses\\n         the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience.\\n         Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this\\n         header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly\\n         used browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC\\n         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\\n        :type user_agent: str\\n        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with\\n         consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\\n         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for\\n         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same\\n         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign\\n         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple\\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\\n        :type client_id: str\\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\\n        :type client_ip: str\\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\\n         you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but\\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\\n        :type location: str\\n        :param action_type: A string that's used by logging to determine\\n         whether the request is coming from an interactive session or a page\\n         load. The following are the possible values. 1) Edit\u2014The request is\\n         from an interactive session 2) Load\u2014The request is from a page load.\\n         Possible values include: 'Edit', 'Load'\\n        :type action_type: str or\\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.language.spellcheck.models.ActionType\\n        :param app_name: The unique name of your app. The name must be known\\n         by Bing. Do not include this parameter unless you have previously\\n         contacted Bing to get a unique app name. To get a unique name, contact\\n         your Bing Business Development manager.\\n        :type app_name: str\\n        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where\\n         the results come from. This API supports only the United States\\n         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If\\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and\\n         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\\n        :type country_code: str\\n        :param client_machine_name: A unique name of the device that the\\n         request is being made from. Generate a unique value for each device\\n         (the value is unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug\\n         issues and improve the quality of corrections.\\n        :type client_machine_name: str\\n        :param doc_id: A unique ID that identifies the document that the text\\n         belongs to.

The service uses the ID to help debug issues and improve\\n         the quality of corrections.\\n        :type doc_id: str\\n        :param market: The market where the results come from. You are\\n         strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying\\n         the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and\\n         optimal response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are\\n         mutually exclusive\u2014do not specify both.\\n        :type market: str\\n        :param session_id: A unique ID that identifies this user session.\\n         Generate a unique value for each user session (the value is\\n         unimportant).

For\\n         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN\\n         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.\\n         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt\\n         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a\\n         different language.
