The test is applicable to random vectors of arbitrary length\n    (see the notes section for more details).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : array_like, 1-D or 2-D\n        If `x` is 1-D than it is assumed to be a vector of observations of a\n        single random variable. If `x` is 2-D than the rows should be\n        observations and the columns are treated as the components of a\n        random vector, i.e., each column represents a different component of\n        the random vector `x`.\n    y : array_like, 1-D or 2-D\n        Same as `x`, but only the number of observation has to match that of\n        `x`. If `y` is 2-D note that the number of columns of `y` (i.e., the\n        number of components in the random vector) does not need to match\n        the number of columns in `x`.\n    B : int, optional, default=`None`\n        The number of iterations to perform when evaluating the null\n        distribution of the test statistic when the `emp` method is\n        applied (see below). if `B` is `None` than as in [1]_ we set\n        `B` to be ``B = 200 + 5000/n``, where `n` is the number of\n        observations.\n    method : {'auto', 'emp', 'asym'}, optional, default=auto\n        The method by which to obtain the p-value for the test.\n\n        - `auto` : Default method. The number of observations will be used to\n          determine the method.\n        - `emp` : Empirical evaluation of the p-value using permutations of\n          the rows of `y` to obtain the null distribution.\n        - `asym` : An asymptotic approximation of the distribution of the test\n          statistic is used to find the p-value.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    test_statistic : float\n        The value of the test statistic used in the test.\n    pval : float\n        The p-value.\n    chosen_method : str\n        The method that was used to obtain the p-value. Mostly relevant when\n        the function is called with `method='auto'`.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The test applies to random vectors of arbitrary dimensions, i.e., `x`\n    can be a 1-D vector of observations for a single random variable while\n    `y` can be a `k` by `n` 2-D array (where `k > 1`). In other words, it\n    is also possible for `x` and `y` to both be 2-D arrays and have the\n    same number of rows (observations) while differing in the number of\n    columns.\n\n    As noted in [1]_ the statistics are sensitive to all types of departures\n    from independence, including nonlinear or nonmonotone dependence\n    structure.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
