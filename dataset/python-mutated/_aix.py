Lib/ctypes.util.find_library() support for AIX
Similar approach as done for Darwin support by using separate files
but unlike Darwin - no extension such as ctypes.macholib.*

dlopen() is an interface to AIX initAndLoad() - primary documentation at:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/dlopen.htm
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.basetrf1/load.htm

AIX supports two styles for dlopen(): svr4 (System V Release 4) which is common on posix
platforms, but also a BSD style - aka SVR3.

From AIX 5.3 Difference Addendum (December 2004)
2.9 SVR4 linking affinity
Nowadays, there are two major object file formats used by the operating systems:
XCOFF: The COFF enhanced by IBM and others. The original COFF (Common
Object File Format) was the base of SVR3 and BSD 4.2 systems.
ELF:   Executable and Linking Format that was developed by AT&T and is a
base for SVR4 UNIX.

While the shared library content is identical on AIX - one is located as a filepath name
(svr4 style) and the other is located as a member of an archive (and the archive
is located as a filepath name).

The key difference arises when supporting multiple abi formats (i.e., 32 and 64 bit).
For svr4 either only one ABI is supported, or there are two directories, or there
are different file names. The most common solution for multiple ABI is multiple
directories.

For the XCOFF (aka AIX) style - one directory (one archive file) is sufficient
as multiple shared libraries can be in the archive - even sharing the same name.
In documentation the archive is also referred to as the "base" and the shared
library object is referred to as the "member".

For dlopen() on AIX (read initAndLoad()) the calls are similar.
Default activity occurs when no path information is provided. When path
information is provided dlopen() does not search any other directories.

For SVR4 - the shared library name is the name of the file expected: libFOO.so
For AIX - the shared library is expressed as base(member). The search is for the
base (e.g., libFOO.a) and once the base is found the shared library - identified by
member (e.g., libFOO.so, or shr.o) is located and loaded.

The mode bit RTLD_MEMBER tells initAndLoad() that it needs to use the AIX (SVR3)
naming style.
