        "The AutoSuggest API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back a\n        list of query suggestions. This section provides technical details\n        about the query parameters and headers that you use to request\n        suggestions and the JSON response objects that contain them.\n\n        :param query: The user's search term.\n        :type query: str\n        :param accept_language: A comma-delimited list of one or more\n         languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing\n         order of preference. For additional information, including expected\n         format, see\n         [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\n         This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do\n         not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the\n         [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#cc)\n         query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing\n         uses the first supported language it finds from the list and combines\n         it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a\n         supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that\n         supports the request or it uses an aggregated or default market for\n         the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see the\n         BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc query parameter\n         only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the\n         [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#mkt)\n         and\n         [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#setlang)\n         query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a\n         label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the\n         JSON response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the\n         response objects apply the specified language.\n        :type accept_language: str\n        :param pragma: By default, Bing returns cached content, if available.\n         To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header\n         to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).\n        :type pragma: str\n        :param user_agent: The user agent originating the request. Bing uses\n         the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience.\n         Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header.\n         The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used\n         browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC\n         2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The\n         following are examples of user-agent strings.

Bing often flights new\n         features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for\n         assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same\n         client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign\n         the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple\n         conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For\n         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\n         the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the\n         client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history,\n         providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\n         to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by\n         a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of\n         results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\n         click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although\n         optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the\n         client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device\n         combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user\n         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of\n         results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on\n         the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not\n         include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns\n         it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you\n         should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user\n         uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API\n         request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\n         client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP\n         cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a\n         session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's\n         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your\n         app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing\n         responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes\n         this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\n         requests for the user on that device. If you include the\n         X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.\n        :type client_id: str\n        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The\n         IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the\n         location information to determine safe search behavior. Although\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\n         X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,\n         by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in\n         the location not being anywhere near the device's actual location,\n         which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.\n        :type client_ip: str\n        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that\n         describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location\n         information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant\n         local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The\n         following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.\n         lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The\n         latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal\n         to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive\n         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of\n         the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than\n         or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values\n         indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern\n         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the\n         horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the\n         device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,\n         380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.\n         ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\n         location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January\n         1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction\n         of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through\n         360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only\n         if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity\n         (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.\n         alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are\n         (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical\n         accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the\n         alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information\n         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although\n         optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical\n         location. Providing the location is especially important if the\n         client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical\n         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,\n         you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but\n         at a minimum, you should include this header.\n        :type location: str\n        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where\n         the results come from. This API supports only the United States\n         market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If\n         you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language\n         header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the\n         languages list, and combine that language with the country code that\n         you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the\n         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the\n         closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use\n         an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified\n         one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query\n         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you\n         should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and\n         the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.\n        :type country_code: str\n        :param market: The market where the results come from. You are\n         strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying\n         the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and\n         optimal response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are\n         mutually exclusive—do not specify both.\n        :type market: str\n        :param safe_search: Filter suggestions for adult content. The\n         following are the possible filter values. Off: Return suggestions with\n         adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return suggestion with adult\n         text but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return news\n         articles with adult text, images, or videos. If the request comes from\n         a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to\n         Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use\n         the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may\n         contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query\n         parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on\n         the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.\n         Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'\n        :type safe_search: str or\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.search.autosuggest.models.SafeSearch\n        :param set_lang: The language to use for user interface strings.\n         Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For\n         example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN\n         (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.\n         Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt\n         unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a\n         different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header are\n         mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a\n         string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user\n         interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to\n         Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified\n         language.\n        :type set_lang: str\n        :param response_format: The media type to use for the response. The\n         following are the possible case-insensitive values: JSON, JSONLD. The\n         default is JSON. If you specify JSONLD, the response body includes\n         JSON-LD objects that contain the search results.\n        :type response_format: list[str or\n         ~azure.cognitiveservices.search.autosuggest.models.ResponseFormat]\n        :param dict custom_headers: headers that will be added to the request\n        :param bool raw: returns the direct response alongside the\n         deserialized response\n        :param operation_config: :ref:`Operation configuration\n         overrides<msrest:optionsforoperations>`.\n        :return: Suggestions or ClientRawResponse if raw=true\n        :rtype: ~azure.cognitiveservices.search.autosuggest.models.Suggestions\n         or ~msrest.pipeline.ClientRawResponse\n        :raises:\n         :class:`ErrorResponseException<azure.cognitiveservices.search.autosuggest.models.ErrorResponseException>`\n        "
