Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `value` and `label`. Anything contained in\n            tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for\n            example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the\n            secondary box completely, use an empty tag\n            `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offset\n            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position\n            axis units). In "group" barmode, traces that set\n            "offset" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode\n            instead.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        offsetsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `offset`.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the bars.

If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `text`.\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`.

"outside" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            "none", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.barpolar.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one box per\n        distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list is\n        provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is\n        positioned with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if\n        provided.

Other box features\n        relying on statistics namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`,\n        `notchspan` can be set directly by the users.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover. For box traces, the name will\n            also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and\n            `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the\n            position axis is categorical\n        notched\n            Determines whether or not notches are drawn. Notches\n            displays a confidence interval around the median. We\n            compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 *\n            IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and\n            N is the sample size. If two boxes\' notches do not\n            overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ.\n            See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home\n            /notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to False\n            unless `notchwidth` or `notchspan` is set.\n        notchspan\n            Sets the notch span from the boxes\' `median` values.\n            There should be as many items as the number of boxes\n            desired. This attribute has effect only under the\n            q1/median/q3 signature. If `notchspan` is not provided\n            but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we compute it as\n            1.57 * IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size.\n        notchspansrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `notchspan`.\n        notchwidth\n            Sets the width of the notches relative to the box\'\n            width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the box(es).

The "linear" method uses the 25th percentile\n            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using\n            method #10 (listed on\n            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The\n            "exclusive" method uses the median to divide the\n            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,\n            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is\n            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of\n            the upper half. The "inclusive" method also uses the\n            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves\n            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in\n            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half\n            and Q3 the median of the upper half.\n        sd\n            Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as\n            many items as the number of boxes desired. This\n            attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3\n            signature. If `sd` is not provided but a sample (in `y`\n            or `x`) is set, we compute the standard deviation for\n            each box using the sample values.\n        sdmultiple\n            Scales the box size when sizemode=sd Allowing boxes to\n            be drawn across any stddev range For example 1-stddev,\n            3-stddev, 5-stddev\n        sdsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `sd`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Selected` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showwhiskers\n            Determines whether or not whiskers are visible.\n            Defaults to true for `sizemode` "quartiles", false for\n            "sd".\n        sizemode\n            Sets the upper and lower bound for the boxes quartiles\n            means box is drawn between Q1 and Q3 SD means the box\n            is drawn between Mean +- Standard Deviation Argument\n            sdmultiple (default 1) to scale the box size So it\n            could be drawn 1-stddev, 3-stddev etc\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each sample\n            value. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        upperfence\n            Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute\n            has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If\n            `upperfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or\n            `x`) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample\n            point above 1.5 times the IQR.\n        upperfencesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `upperfence`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        whiskerwidth\n            Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box\'\n            width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        width\n            Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0\n            (default value) the width is automatically selected\n            based on the positions of other box traces in the same\n            subplot.\n        x\n            Sets the x sample data or coordinates.

See overview for more info.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits.

If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to this trace\'s sample points.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        whiskerwidth\n            Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box\'\n            width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear coordinate\n            will be generated.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet\n            point.

Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Same as `text`.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        locationmode\n            Determines the set of locations used to match entries\n            in `locations` to regions on the map. Values "ISO-3",\n            "USA-states", *country names* correspond to features on\n            the base map and value "geojson-id" corresponds to\n            features from a custom GeoJSON linked to the `geojson`\n            attribute.\n        locations\n            Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Selected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Stream`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each location.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        z\n            Sets the color values.\n        zauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the\n            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.\n        zmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must\n            be set as well.\n        zmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no\n            effect when `zauto` is `false`.\n        zmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must\n            be set as well.\n        zsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `z`.\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contour.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        ncontours\n            Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual\n            number of contours will be chosen automatically to be\n            less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an\n            effect only if `autocontour` is True or if\n            `contours.size` is missing.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.contour.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each z value.\n        textfont\n            For this trace it only has an effect if `coloring` is\n            set to "heatmap". Sets the text font.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            For this trace it only has an effect if `coloring` is\n            set to "heatmap". Template string used for rendering\n            the information text that appear on points. Note that\n            this will override `textinfo`. Variables are inserted\n            using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are\n            formatted using d3-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.\n        transpose\n            Transposes the z data.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        ncontours\n            Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual\n            number of contours will be chosen automatically to be\n            less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        z\n            Sets the z data.\n        zauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the\n            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.\n        zmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must\n            be set as well.\n        zmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no\n            effect when `zauto` is `false`.\n        zmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must\n            be set as well.\n        zsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `z`.\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

If "mapbox" (the default value),\n            the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If "mapbox2", the\n            data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair\n            If a single string, the same string appears over all\n            the data points.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        z\n            Sets the points\' weight. For example, a value of 10\n            would be equivalent to having 10 points of weight 1 in\n            the same spot\n        zauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the\n            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.\n        zmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must\n            be set as well.\n        zmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no\n            effect when `zauto` is `false`.\n        zmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must\n            be set as well.\n        zsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `z`.\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

Also regarding\n            graphs including only \'horizontal\' funnels, "autorange"\n            on the "y-axis" are set to "reversed".\n        outsidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.funnel.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `text`.\n        textinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.\n            In the case of having multiple funnels, percentages &\n            totals are computed separately (per trace).\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"\n            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated\n            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            "none", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `percentInitial`, `percentPrevious`,\n            `percentTotal`, `label` and `value`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".

        '\n        Add a new Heatmap trace\n\n        The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is\n        set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a 2D list of values\n        (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`\n        is a 2D list, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by\n        default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the\n        y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the\n        i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th\n        partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)\n        and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of\n        the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.\n        Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)\n        elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the\n        center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If\n        M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the\n        heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D list, the x and y\n        coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to\n        form data triplets.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        autocolorscale\n            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette\n            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by\n            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        coloraxis\n            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to\n            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",\n            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes\n            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,\n            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color\n            scales can be linked to the same color axis.\n        colorbar\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.ColorBar` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array\n            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,\n            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,\n            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are\n            required. For example, `[[0, \'rgb(0,0,255)\'], [1,\n            \'rgb(255,0,0)\']]`. To control the bounds of the\n            colorscale in color space, use `zmin` and `zmax`.\n            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name\n            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C\n            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl\n            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the `z` data are filled in. It is defaulted\n            to true if `z` is a one dimensional array and `zsmooth`\n            is not false; otherwise it is defaulted to false.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events.

See `x0` for more info.\n        dy\n            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoverongaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the `z` data have hover labels associated\n            with them.\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

If true, `zmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each z value.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.\n        transpose\n            Transposes the z data.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmapgl.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each z value.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        transpose\n            Transposes the z data.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Marker` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        nbinsx\n            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This\n            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the\n            optimal bin size such that the histogram best\n            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if\n            `xbins.size` is provided.\n        nbinsy\n            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This\n            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the\n            optimal bin size such that the histogram best\n            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if\n            `ybins.size` is provided.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the\n            value of the each bar spans along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        outsidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Selected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a\n            single string, the same string appears over all bars.\n            If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to\n            the this trace\'s coordinates.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"\n            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated\n            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            "none", no text appears.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `label` and `value`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

The\n        resulting distribution is visualized as a contour plot.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        autobinx\n            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-\n            determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.\n            However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will\n            update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`\n            from the trace.\n        autobiny\n            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-\n            determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.\n            However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will\n            update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`\n            from the trace.\n        autocolorscale\n            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette\n            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by\n            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        autocontour\n            Determines whether or not the contour level attributes\n            are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of\n            contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set\n            the contour level attributes in `contours`.\n        bingroup\n            Set the `xbingroup` and `ybingroup` default prefix For\n            example, setting a `bingroup` of 1 on two histogram2d\n            traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match\n            separately.\n        coloraxis\n            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to\n            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",\n            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes\n            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,\n            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color\n            scales can be linked to the same color axis.\n        colorbar\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.ColorBa\n            r` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array\n            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,\n            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,\n            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are\n            required. For example, `[[0, \'rgb(0,0,255)\'], [1,\n            \'rgb(255,0,0)\']]`. To control the bounds of the\n            colorscale in color space, use `zmin` and `zmax`.\n            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name\n            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C\n            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl\n            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.\n        contours\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Contour\n            s` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum.

If "count", the histogram values are computed by\n            counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If\n            "sum", "avg", "min", "max", the histogram values are\n            computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the\n            maximum of the values lying inside each bin\n            respectively.\n        histnorm\n            Specifies the type of normalization used for this\n            histogram trace. If "", the span of each bar\n            corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the\n            number of data points lying inside the bins). If\n            "percent" / "probability", the span of each bar\n            corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences\n            with respect to the total number of sample points\n            (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If\n            "density", the span of each bar corresponds to the\n            number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of\n            the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals\n            the total number of sample points). If *probability\n            density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the\n            probability that an event will fall into the\n            corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS\n            equals 1).\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Hoverla\n            bel` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variable `z` Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Legendg\n            rouptitle` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Line`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Marker`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        nbinsx\n            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This\n            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the\n            optimal bin size such that the histogram best\n            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if\n            `xbins.size` is provided.\n        nbinsy\n            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This\n            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the\n            optimal bin size such that the histogram best\n            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if\n            `ybins.size` is provided.\n        ncontours\n            Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual\n            number of contours will be chosen automatically to be\n            less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an\n            effect only if `autocontour` is True or if\n            `contours.size` is missing.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram2dcontour.Stream`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        textfont\n            For this trace it only has an effect if `coloring` is\n            set to "heatmap". Sets the text font.\n        texttemplate\n            For this trace it only has an effect if `coloring` is\n            set to "heatmap". Template string used for rendering\n            the information text that appear on points. Note that\n            this will override `textinfo`. Variables are inserted\n            using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are\n            formatted using d3-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x0\n            Set the image\'s x position. The left edge of the image\n            (or the right edge if the x axis is reversed or dx is\n            negative) will be found at xmin=x0-dx/2\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        y0\n            Set the image\'s y position. The top edge of the image\n            (or the bottom edge if the y axis is NOT reversed or if\n            dy is negative) will be found at ymin=y0-dy/2. By\n            default when an image trace is included, the y axis\n            will be reversed so that the image is right-side-up,\n            but you can disable this by setting\n            yaxis.autorange=true or by providing an explicit y axis\n            range.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        z\n            A 2-dimensional array in which each element is an array\n            of 3 or 4 numbers representing a color.\n        zmax\n            Array defining the higher bound for each color\n            component. Note that the default value will depend on\n            the colormodel. For the `rgb` colormodel, it is [255,\n            255, 255]. For the `rgba` colormodel, it is [255, 255,\n            255, 1]. For the `rgba256` colormodel, it is [255, 255,\n            255, 255]. For the `hsl` colormodel, it is [360, 100,\n            100]. For the `hsla` colormodel, it is [360, 100, 100,\n            1].\n        zmin\n            Array defining the lower bound for each color\n            component. Note that the default value will depend on\n            the colormodel. For the `rgb` colormodel, it is [0, 0,\n            0]. For the `rgba` colormodel, it is [0, 0, 0, 0]. For\n            the `rgba256` colormodel, it is [0, 0, 0, 0]. For the\n            `hsl` colormodel, it is [0, 0, 0]. For the `hsla`\n            colormodel, it is [0, 0, 0, 0].\n        zsmooth\n            Picks a smoothing algorithm used to smooth `z` data.\n            This only applies for image traces that use the\n            `source` attribute.\n        zsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `z`.\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

        '\n        Add a new Mesh3d trace\n\n        Draws sets of triangles with coordinates given by three\n        1-dimensional arrays in `x`, `y`, `z` and (1) a sets of `i`,\n        `j`, `k` indices (2) Delaunay triangulation or (3) the Alpha-\n        shape algorithm or (4) the Convex-hull algorithm\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        alphahull\n            Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived\n            from the set of vertices (points) represented by the\n            `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays\n            are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is\n            preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If "-1",\n            Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly\n            suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer\n            surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In\n            case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at\n            more than one point it will result triangles that are\n            very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If ">0",\n            the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the\n            positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the\n            alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the\n            parameter for the mesh fitting. If 0,  the convex-hull\n            algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or\n            if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z`\n            point set into a convex hull.\n        autocolorscale\n            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette\n            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by\n            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        cauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or\n            the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.\n        cmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmin`\n            must be set as well.\n        cmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as `intensity`. Has no\n            effect when `cauto` is `false`.\n        cmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmax`\n            must be set as well.\n        color\n            Sets the color of the whole mesh\n        coloraxis\n            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to\n            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",\n            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes\n            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,\n            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color\n            scales can be linked to the same color axis.\n        colorbar\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.ColorBar` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array\n            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,\n            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,\n            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are\n            required. For example, `[[0, \'rgb(0,0,255)\'], [1,\n            \'rgb(255,0,0)\']]`. To control the bounds of the\n            colorscale in color space, use `cmin` and `cmax`.\n            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name\n            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C\n            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl\n            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.\n        contour\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Contour` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        delaunayaxis\n            Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is\n            perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay\n            triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are\n            not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate\n            Delaunay triangulation.\n        facecolor\n            Sets the color of each face Overrides "color" and\n            "vertexcolor".\n        facecolorsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `facecolor`.\n        flatshading\n            Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied\n            to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-\n            poly look via flat reflections.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Same as `text`.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        i\n            A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between\n            0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing\n            the "first" vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],\n            j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in\n            the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet\n            `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,\n            each element in `i` represents a point in space, which\n            is the first vertex of a triangle.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        intensity\n            Sets the intensity values for vertices or cells as\n            defined by `intensitymode`. It can be used for plotting\n            fields on meshes.\n        intensitymode\n            Determines the source of `intensity` values.\n        intensitysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `intensity`.\n        isrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `i`.\n        j\n            A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between\n            0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing\n            the "second" vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],\n            j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in\n            the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet\n            `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,\n            each element in `j` represents a point in space, which\n            is the second vertex of a triangle.\n        jsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `j`.\n        k\n            A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between\n            0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing\n            the "third" vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],\n            j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in\n            the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet\n            `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,\n            each element in `k` represents a point in space, which\n            is the third vertex of a triangle.\n        ksrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `k`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        lighting\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lighting` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        lightposition\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Lightposition`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

Please note that in\n            the case of using high `opacity` values for example a\n            value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and\n            0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple\n            transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in\n            depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved\n            in the near future and is subject to change.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `cmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        scene\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s 3D coordinate\n            system and a 3D scene. If "scene" (the default value),\n            the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If\n            "scene2", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to\n            `layout.scene2`, and so on.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.mesh3d.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If\n            trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        vertexcolor\n            Sets the color of each vertex Overrides "color". While\n            Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and\n            255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA\n            format, the alpha color should be normalized to be\n            between 0 and 1.\n        vertexcolorsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `vertexcolor`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xbounds\n            Specify `xbounds` in the shape of `[xMin, xMax] to\n            avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in\n            conjunction with `xy` and `ybounds` for the performance\n            benefits.\n        xboundssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `xbounds`.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `x`.\n        xy\n            Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y`\n            separately. If supplied, it must be a typed\n            `Float32Array` array that represents points such that\n            `xy[i * 2] = x[i]` and `xy[i * 2 + 1] = y[i]`\n        xysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `xy`.\n        y\n            Sets the y coordinates.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        ybounds\n            Specify `ybounds` in the shape of `[yMin, yMax] to\n            avoid looping through the `xy` typed array.

So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        valueformat\n            Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting\n            mini-languages which are very similar to those in\n            Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n        valuesuffix\n            Adds a unit to follow the value in the hover tooltip.\n            Add a space if a separation is necessary from the\n            value.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

        '\n        Add a new Scatter trace\n\n        The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,\n        text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter\n        point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on\n        the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are\n        achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to\n        numerical arrays.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        alignmentgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls\n            whether bars compute their positional range dependently\n            or independently.\n        cliponaxis\n            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are\n            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and\n            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure\n            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below\n            traces*.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        dx\n            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.\n        dy\n            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.\n        error_x\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.ErrorX` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        error_y\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.ErrorY` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        fill\n            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to\n            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets\n            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use\n            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"\n            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and\n            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and\n            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those\n            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area\n            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave\n            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or\n            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With\n            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some\n            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,\n            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing\n            order.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        fillpattern\n            Sets the pattern within the marker.\n        groupnorm\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of\n            this `stackgroup`. With "fraction", the value of each\n            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all\n            trace values at that location. "percent" is the same\n            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are\n            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one\n            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there\n            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",\n            otherwise it is "points".\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Legendgrouptitle`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Only relevant in the following cases: 1. when\n            `scattermode` is set to "group". 2. when `stackgroup`\n            is used, and only the first `orientation` found in the\n            `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is\n            "legendonly" but not if it is `false`. Sets the\n            stacking direction. With "v" ("h"), the y (x) values of\n            subsequent traces are added. Also affects the default\n            value of `fill`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stackgaps\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is "legendonly" but not\n            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With "interpolate" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is "h"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using "tonexty" ("tonextx")\n            if `orientation` is "h" ("v") and sets the default\n            `mode` to "lines" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}".

        '\n        Add a new Scatterpolar trace\n\n        The scatterpolar trace type encompasses line charts, scatter\n        charts, text charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates.\n        The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r`\n        (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Text (appearing\n        either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble\n        charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or\n        `marker.color` to numerical arrays.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        cliponaxis\n            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are\n            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and\n            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure\n            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below\n            traces*.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        dr\n            Sets the r coordinate step.\n        dtheta\n            Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the\n            `dtheta` step equals the subplot\'s period divided by\n            the length of the `r` coordinates.\n        fill\n            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with\n            `fillcolor` if not "none". scatterpolar has a subset of\n            the options available to scatter. "toself" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolar.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there\n            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",\n            otherwise it is "points".\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace.

Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolar.Line`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolar.Marker`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        r\n            Sets the radial coordinates\n        r0\n            Alternate to `r`.

        '\n        Add a new Scatterpolargl trace\n\n        The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter\n        charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL\n        plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines\n        is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble\n        charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or\n        `marker.color` to numerical arrays.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        dr\n            Sets the r coordinate step.\n        dtheta\n            Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the\n            `dtheta` step equals the subplot\'s period divided by\n            the length of the `r` coordinates.\n        fill\n            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to\n            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets\n            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use\n            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"\n            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and\n            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and\n            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those\n            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area\n            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave\n            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or\n            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With\n            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some\n            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,\n            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing\n            order.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Legendgroup\n            title` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Line`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Marker`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        r\n            Sets the radial coordinates\n        r0\n            Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r\n            coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dr` the step.\n        rsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `r`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Selected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Stream`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        subplot\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s data coordinates\n            and a polar subplot. If "polar" (the default value),\n            the data refer to `layout.polar`. If "polar2", the data\n            refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `r`, `theta` and `text`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        theta\n            Sets the angular coordinates\n        theta0\n            Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta\n            coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the\n            starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.\n        thetasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `theta`.\n        thetaunit\n            Sets the unit of input "theta" values. Has an effect\n            only when on "linear" angular axes.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

        '\n        Add a new Scattersmith trace\n\n        The scattersmith trace type encompasses line charts, scatter\n        charts, text charts, and bubble charts in smith coordinates.\n        The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `real`\n        and `imag` (imaginary) coordinates Text (appearing either on\n        the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are\n        achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to\n        numerical arrays.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        cliponaxis\n            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are\n            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and\n            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure\n            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below\n            traces*.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        fill\n            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with\n            `fillcolor` if not "none". scattersmith has a subset of\n            the options available to scatter. "toself" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions? If the fill is "toself" or "tonext" and there\n            are no markers or text, then the default is "fills",\n            otherwise it is "points".\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        imag\n            Sets the imaginary component of the data, in units of\n            normalized impedance such that real=1, imag=0 is the\n            center of the chart.\n        imagsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `imag`.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Legendgroupti\n            tle` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Line`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Marker`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        real\n            Sets the real component of the data, in units of\n            normalized impedance such that real=1, imag=0 is the\n            center of the chart.\n        realsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `real`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Selected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Stream`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        subplot\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s data coordinates\n            and a smith subplot. If "smith" (the default value),\n            the data refer to `layout.smith`. If "smith2", the data\n            refer to `layout.smith2`, and so on.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `real`, `imag` and `text`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattersmith.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `a`, `b`, `c` and `text`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterternary.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.splom.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        xaxes\n            Sets the list of x axes corresponding to dimensions of\n            this splom trace.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        level\n            Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is\n            rendered. Set `level` to `\'\'` to start from the root\n            node in the hierarchy.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name.

This option refers to the root of the hierarchy\n            presented at the center of a sunburst graph. Please\n            note that if a hierarchy has multiple root nodes, this\n            option won\'t have any effect and `insidetextfont` would\n            be used.\n        parents\n            Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty\n            string items \'\' are understood to reference the root\n            node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is filled, `parents`\n            items are understood to be "ids" themselves. When `ids`\n            is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in\n            `labels`, but beware they must be unique.\n        parentssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `parents`.\n        root\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.sunburst.Root` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        rotation\n            Rotates the whole diagram counterclockwise by some\n            angle.

If\n            trace `textinfo` contains a "text" flag, these elements\n            will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`\n            contains a "text" flag and "hovertext" is not set,\n            these elements will be seen in the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `textinfo`.\n        textinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `currentPath`, `root`, `entry`,\n            `percentRoot`, `percentEntry`, `percentParent`, `label`\n            and `value`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        values\n            Sets the values associated with each of the sectors.\n            Use with `branchvalues` to determine how the values are\n            summed.\n        valuessrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `values`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

Coordinates in `x` and\n        `y` can either be 1D lists or 2D lists (e.g. to graph\n        parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and\n        y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a\n        unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by\n        default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which\n        should be a 2D list, where its bounds can be controlled using\n        `cmin` and `cmax`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        autocolorscale\n            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette\n            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by\n            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        cauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here z or surfacecolor)\n            or the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax` Defaults to\n            `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.\n        cmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain.

At minimum,\n            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are\n            required. For example, `[[0, \'rgb(0,0,255)\'], [1,\n            \'rgb(255,0,0)\']]`. To control the bounds of the\n            colorscale in color space, use `cmin` and `cmax`.\n            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name\n            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C\n            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl\n            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the `z` data are filled in.\n        contours\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Contours` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum.

When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        lighting\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Lighting` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        lightposition\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Lightposition`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in\n            the case of using high `opacity` values for example a\n            value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and\n            0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple\n            transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in\n            depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved\n            in the near future and is subject to change.\n        opacityscale\n            Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an\n            array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to\n            an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest\n            (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example,\n            `[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]` means that higher/lower\n            values would have higher opacity values and those in\n            the middle would be more transparent Alternatively,\n            `opacityscale` may be a palette name string of the\n            following list: \'min\', \'max\', \'extremes\' and \'uniform\'.\n            The default is \'uniform\'.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `cmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        scene\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s 3D coordinate\n            system and a 3D scene. If "scene" (the default value),\n            the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If\n            "scene2", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to\n            `layout.scene2`, and so on.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.surface.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        surfacecolor\n            Sets the surface color values, used for setting a color\n            scale independent of `z`.\n        surfacecolorsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `surfacecolor`.\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each z value. If\n            trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        values\n            Sets the values associated with each of the sectors.\n            Use with `branchvalues` to determine how the values are\n            summed.\n        valuessrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `values`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Same as `text`.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        jitter\n            Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.\n            If 0, the sample points align along the distribution\n            axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random\n            jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Legendgrouptitle`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Marker` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        meanline\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Meanline` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover. For violin traces, the name\n            will also be used for the position coordinate, if `x`\n            and `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and\n            the position axis is categorical. Note that the trace\n            name is also used as a default value for attribute\n            `scalegroup` (please see its description for details).\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If "v" ("h"),\n            the distribution is visualized along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        pointpos\n            Sets the position of the sample points in relation to\n            the violins. If 0, the sample points are places over\n            the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values\n            correspond to positions to the right (left) for\n            vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal\n            violins.\n        points\n            If "outliers", only the sample points lying outside the\n            whiskers are shown If "suspectedoutliers", the outlier\n            points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3\n            or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see\n            `outliercolor`) If "all", all sample points are shown\n            If False, only the violins are shown with no sample\n            points. Defaults to "suspectedoutliers" when\n            `marker.outliercolor` or `marker.line.outliercolor` is\n            set, otherwise defaults to "outliers".\n        quartilemethod\n            Sets the method used to compute the sample\'s Q1 and Q3\n            quartiles. The "linear" method uses the 25th percentile\n            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using\n            method #10 (listed on\n            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The\n            "exclusive" method uses the median to divide the\n            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,\n            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is\n            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of\n            the upper half. The "inclusive" method also uses the\n            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves\n            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in\n            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half\n            and Q3 the median of the upper half.\n        scalegroup\n            If there are multiple violins that should be sized\n            according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link\n            them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by\n            every trace in the same group. If a violin\'s `width` is\n            undefined, `scalegroup` will default to the trace\'s\n            name. In this case, violins with the same names will be\n            linked together\n        scalemode\n            Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is\n            determined. "width" means each violin has the same\n            (max) width "count" means the violins are scaled by the\n            number of sample points making up each violin.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Selected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        side\n            Determines on which side of the position value the\n            density function making up one half of a violin is\n            plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under\n            "overlay" mode, where one trace has `side` set to\n            "positive" and the other to "negative".\n        span\n            Sets the span in data space for which the density\n            function will be computed. Has an effect only when\n            `spanmode` is set to "manual".\n        spanmode\n            Sets the method by which the span in data space where\n            the density function will be computed. "soft" means the\n            span goes from the sample\'s minimum value minus two\n            bandwidths to the sample\'s maximum value plus two\n            bandwidths. "hard" means the span goes from the\n            sample\'s minimum to its maximum value. For custom span\n            settings, use mode "manual" and fill in the `span`\n            attribute.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each sample\n            value. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If 0\n            (default value) the width is automatically selected\n            based on the positions of other violin traces in the\n            same subplot.\n        x\n            Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for\n            more info.\n        x0\n            Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the\n            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using\n            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `x`.\n        y\n            Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for\n            more info.\n        y0\n            Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the\n            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using\n            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        yhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well\n        as spaceframe between iso-min and iso-max values could also be\n        drawn using this trace.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        autocolorscale\n            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette\n            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by\n            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or\n            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be\n            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`\n            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.\n        caps\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Caps` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        cauto\n            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed\n            with respect to the input data (here `value`) or the\n            bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax` Defaults to `false`\n            when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.\n        cmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmin` must\n            be set as well.\n        cmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as `value`. Has no\n            effect when `cauto` is `false`.\n        cmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmax` must\n            be set as well.\n        coloraxis\n            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to\n            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",\n            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes\n            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,\n            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color\n            scales can be linked to the same color axis.\n        colorbar\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.ColorBar` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array\n            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,\n            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,\n            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are\n            required. For example, `[[0, \'rgb(0,0,255)\'], [1,\n            \'rgb(255,0,0)\']]`. To control the bounds of the\n            colorscale in color space, use `cmin` and `cmax`.\n            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name\n            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C\n            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl\n            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.\n        contour\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Contour` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note\n            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in\n            the markers DOM elements\n        customdatasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `customdata`.\n        flatshading\n            Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied\n            to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-\n            poly look via flat reflections.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Same as `text`.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        isomax\n            Sets the maximum boundary for iso-surface plot.\n        isomin\n            Sets the minimum boundary for iso-surface plot.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Legendgrouptitle`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        lighting\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Lighting` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        lightposition\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Lightposition`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in\n            the case of using high `opacity` values for example a\n            value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and\n            0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple\n            transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in\n            depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved\n            in the near future and is subject to change.\n        opacityscale\n            Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an\n            array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to\n            an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest\n            (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example,\n            `[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]` means that higher/lower\n            values would have higher opacity values and those in\n            the middle would be more transparent Alternatively,\n            `opacityscale` may be a palette name string of the\n            following list: \'min\', \'max\', \'extremes\' and \'uniform\'.\n            The default is \'uniform\'.\n        reversescale\n            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`\n            will correspond to the last color in the array and\n            `cmax` will correspond to the first color.\n        scene\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s 3D coordinate\n            system and a 3D scene. If "scene" (the default value),\n            the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If\n            "scene2", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to\n            `layout.scene2`, and so on.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showscale\n            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for\n            this trace.\n        slices\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Slices` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        spaceframe\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Spaceframe`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        surface\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.volume.Surface` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If\n            trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        value\n            Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices.\n        valuehoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `value`  using\n            d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d\n            3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values\n            are formatted using generic number format.\n        valuesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `value`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the X coordinates of the vertices on X axis.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

        '\n        Add a new Waterfall trace\n\n        Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the\n        contribution of various elements (either positive or negative)\n        in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is\n        set in `y` if `orientation` is set to "v" (the default) and the\n        labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to "h", the\n        roles are interchanged.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        alignmentgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls\n            whether bars compute their positional range dependently\n            or independently.\n        base\n            Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis\n            units).\n        cliponaxis\n            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the\n            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines\n            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and\n            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.\n        connector\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Connector`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        constraintext\n            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to\n            be no larger than the bar itself.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when\n            listening to hover, click and selection events.

If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},\n            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several\n            points, "xother" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted\n            using d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for\n            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `initial`, `delta` and `final`. Anything\n            contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the\n            secondary box, for example\n            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a "text" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `ids`.\n        increasing\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Increasing`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        insidetextanchor\n            Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end\n            points in `textposition` "inside" mode.\n        insidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.\n        legend\n            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.\n            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",\n            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in\n            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,\n            etc.\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes\n            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same\n            time when toggling legend items.\n        legendgrouptitle\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Legendgrouptitle\n            ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        legendrank\n            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        measure\n            An array containing types of values. By default the\n            values are considered as \'relative\'. However; it is\n            possible to use \'total\' to compute the sums. Also\n            \'absolute\' could be applied to reset the computed total\n            or to declare an initial value where needed.\n        measuresrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `measure`.\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offset\n            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position\n            axis units). In "group" barmode, traces that set\n            "offset" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode\n            instead.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        offsetsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `offset`.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the\n            value of the each bar spans along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        outsidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace\'s (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and\n            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `text`.\n        textinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.\n            In the case of having multiple waterfalls, totals are\n            computed separately (per trace).\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"\n            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated\n            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            "none", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format\'s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format\'s syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `initial`, `delta`, `final` and `label`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        totals\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.waterfall.Totals` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        widthsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `width`.\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x\n            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        xperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        xperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            alignment of data points on the x axis.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `x`.\n        y\n            Sets the y coordinates.\n        y0\n            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y\n            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dy` the step.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace\'s y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        yhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.\n        yperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y\n            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        yperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        yperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the\n            alignment of data points on the y axis.\n        ysrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `y`.\n        row : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added. Only valid if figure was created using\n            `plotly.tools.make_subplots`.If \'all\', addresses all\n            rows in the specified column(s).\n        col : \'all\', int or None (default)\n            Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be\n            added.

Only valid if all of the\n            following conditions are satisfied:\n              * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.\n              * The row and col arguments are not None\n              * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy\n                (which is the default) and secondary_y True.

Has an effect only if `text` spans two or more\n            lines (i.e. `text` contains one or more <br> HTML tags)\n            or if an explicit width is set to override the text\n            width.\n        arrowcolor\n            Sets the color of the annotation arrow.\n        arrowhead\n            Sets the end annotation arrow head style.\n        arrowside\n            Sets the annotation arrow head position.\n        arrowsize\n            Sets the size of the end annotation arrow head,\n            relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 (default) gives\n            a head about 3x as wide as the line.\n        arrowwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow line.\n        ax\n            Sets the x component of the arrow tail about the arrow\n            head. If `axref` is `pixel`, a positive (negative)\n            component corresponds to an arrow pointing from right\n            to left (left to right). If `axref` is not `pixel` and\n            is exactly the same as `xref`, this is an absolute\n            value on that axis, like `x`, specified in the same\n            coordinates as `xref`.\n        axref\n            Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the\n            annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a x axis id\n            (e.g. "x" or "x2"), the `x` position refers to a x\n            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `x` position refers\n            to the distance from the left of the plotting area in\n            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the\n            left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by\n            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves\n            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in\n            fractions of the domain length from the left of the\n            domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the\n            domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5\n            refers to the point between the left and the right of\n            the domain of the second x axis. In order for absolute\n            positioning of the arrow to work, "axref" must be\n            exactly the same as "xref", otherwise "axref" will\n            revert to "pixel" (explained next). For relative\n            positioning, "axref" can be set to "pixel", in which\n            case the "ax" value is specified in pixels relative to\n            "x". Absolute positioning is useful for trendline\n            annotations which should continue to indicate the\n            correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is\n            useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated\n            point.\n        ay\n            Sets the y component of the arrow tail about the arrow\n            head. If `ayref` is `pixel`, a positive (negative)\n            component corresponds to an arrow pointing from bottom\n            to top (top to bottom). If `ayref` is not `pixel` and\n            is exactly the same as `yref`, this is an absolute\n            value on that axis, like `y`, specified in the same\n            coordinates as `yref`.\n        ayref\n            Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the\n            annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a y axis id\n            (e.g. "y" or "y2"), the `y` position refers to a y\n            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `y` position refers\n            to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in\n            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the\n            bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by\n            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves\n            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in\n            fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the\n            domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the\n            domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5\n            refers to the point between the bottom and the top of\n            the domain of the second y axis. In order for absolute\n            positioning of the arrow to work, "ayref" must be\n            exactly the same as "yref", otherwise "ayref" will\n            revert to "pixel" (explained next). For relative\n            positioning, "ayref" can be set to "pixel", in which\n            case the "ay" value is specified in pixels relative to\n            "y". Absolute positioning is useful for trendline\n            annotations which should continue to indicate the\n            correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is\n            useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated\n            point.\n        bgcolor\n            Sets the background color of the annotation.\n        bordercolor\n            Sets the color of the border enclosing the annotation\n            `text`.\n        borderpad\n            Sets the padding (in px) between the `text` and the\n            enclosing border.\n        borderwidth\n            Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the\n            annotation `text`.\n        captureevents\n            Determines whether the annotation text box captures\n            mouse move and click events, or allows those events to\n            pass through to data points in the plot that may be\n            behind the annotation. By default `captureevents` is\n            False unless `hovertext` is provided. If you use the\n            event `plotly_clickannotation` without `hovertext` you\n            must explicitly enable `captureevents`.\n        clicktoshow\n            Makes this annotation respond to clicks on the plot. If\n            you click a data point that exactly matches the `x` and\n            `y` values of this annotation, and it is hidden\n            (visible: false), it will appear. In "onoff" mode, you\n            must click the same point again to make it disappear,\n            so if you click multiple points, you can show multiple\n            annotations. In "onout" mode, a click anywhere else in\n            the plot (on another data point or not) will hide this\n            annotation. If you need to show/hide this annotation in\n            response to different `x` or `y` values, you can set\n            `xclick` and/or `yclick`. This is useful for example to\n            label the side of a bar. To label markers though,\n            `standoff` is preferred over `xclick` and `yclick`.\n        font\n            Sets the annotation text font.\n        height\n            Sets an explicit height for the text box. null\n            (default) lets the text set the box height. Taller text\n            will be clipped.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.annotation.Hoverlab\n            el` instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovertext\n            Sets text to appear when hovering over this annotation.\n            If omitted or blank, no hover label will appear.\n        name\n            When used in a template, named items are created in the\n            output figure in addition to any items the figure\n            already has in this array. You can modify these items\n            in the output figure by making your own item with\n            `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your\n            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:\n            false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a\n            template.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the annotation (text + arrow).\n        showarrow\n            Determines whether or not the annotation is drawn with\n            an arrow. If True, `text` is placed near the arrow\'s\n            tail. If False, `text` lines up with the `x` and `y`\n            provided.\n        standoff\n            Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end arrowhead\n            away from the position it is pointing at, for example\n            to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom.\n            Note that this shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay`\n            vector, in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves\n            everything by this amount.\n        startarrowhead\n            Sets the start annotation arrow head style.\n        startarrowsize\n            Sets the size of the start annotation arrow head,\n            relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1 (default) gives\n            a head about 3x as wide as the line.\n        startstandoff\n            Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start arrowhead\n            away from the position it is pointing at, for example\n            to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom.\n            Note that this shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay`\n            vector, in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves\n            everything by this amount.\n        templateitemname\n            Used to refer to a named item in this array in the\n            template. Named items from the template will be created\n            even without a matching item in the input figure, but\n            you can modify one by making an item with\n            `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your\n            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:\n            false` to hide it). If there is no template or no\n            matching item, this item will be hidden unless you\n            explicitly show it with `visible: true`.\n        text\n            Sets the text associated with this annotation. Plotly\n            uses a subset of HTML tags to do things like newline\n            (<br>), bold (<b></b>), italics (<i></i>), hyperlinks\n            (<a href=\'...\'></a>). Tags <em>, <sup>, <sub> <span>\n            are also supported.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle at which the `text` is drawn with\n            respect to the horizontal.\n        valign\n            Sets the vertical alignment of the `text` within the\n            box. Has an effect only if an explicit height is set to\n            override the text height.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this annotation is visible.\n        width\n            Sets an explicit width for the text box. null (default)\n            lets the text set the box width. Wider text will be\n            clipped. There is no automatic wrapping; use <br> to\n            start a new line.\n        x\n            Sets the annotation\'s x position. If the axis `type` is\n            "log", then you must take the log of your desired\n            range.

For example, if `x` is\n            set to 1, `xref` to "paper" and `xanchor` to "right"\n            then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up\n            with the right-most edge of the plotting area.

If set to a x\n            axis id (e.g. "x" or "x2"), the `x` position refers to\n            a x coordinate. If set to "paper", the `x` position\n            refers to the distance from the left of the plotting\n            area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds\n            to the left (right).

For example, if `y` is set\n            to 1, `yref` to "paper" and `yanchor` to "top" then the\n            top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the\n            top-most edge of the plotting area.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this shape.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.shape.Line`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        name\n            When used in a template, named items are created in the\n            output figure in addition to any items the figure\n            already has in this array. You can modify these items\n            in the output figure by making your own item with\n            `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your\n            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:\n            false` to hide it).

There are a few\n            restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not\n            relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q,\n            C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius\n            rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider\n            supporting relative commands, but we would have to\n            decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that\n            even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on\n            linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa.\n            no chained "polybezier" commands - specify the segment\n            type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers\n            scaled to the serial numbers of categories because\n            using the categories themselves there would be no way\n            to describe fractional positions On data axes: because\n            space and T are both normal components of path strings,\n            we can\'t use either to separate date from time parts.\n            Therefore we\'ll use underscore for this purpose:\n            2015-02-21_13:45:56.789\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not this shape is shown in the\n            legend.\n        templateitemname\n            Used to refer to a named item in this array in the\n            template. Named items from the template will be created\n            even without a matching item in the input figure, but\n            you can modify one by making an item with\n            `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your\n            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:\n            false` to hide it). If there is no template or no\n            matching item, this item will be hidden unless you\n            explicitly show it with `visible: true`.\n        type\n            Specifies the shape type to be drawn. If "line", a line\n            is drawn from (`x0`,`y0`) to (`x1`,`y1`) with respect\n            to the axes\' sizing mode. If "circle", a circle is\n            drawn from ((`x0`+`x1`)/2, (`y0`+`y1`)/2)) with radius\n            (|(`x0`+`x1`)/2 - `x0`|, |(`y0`+`y1`)/2 -`y0`)|) with\n            respect to the axes\' sizing mode. If "rect", a\n            rectangle is drawn linking (`x0`,`y0`), (`x1`,`y0`),\n            (`x1`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y0`) with respect to\n            the axes\' sizing mode. If "path", draw a custom SVG\n            path using `path`. with respect to the axes\' sizing\n            mode.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this shape is visible. If\n            "legendonly", the shape is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x0\n            Sets the shape\'s starting x position. See `type` and\n            `xsizemode` for more info.\n        x1\n            Sets the shape\'s end x position. See `type` and\n            `xsizemode` for more info.\n        xanchor\n            Only relevant in conjunction with `xsizemode` set to\n            "pixel". Specifies the anchor point on the x axis to\n            which `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path` are\n            relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape\n            to a certain data value. No effect when `xsizemode` not\n            set to "pixel".\n        xref\n            Sets the shape\'s x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis\n            id (e.g. "x" or "x2"), the `x` position refers to a x\n            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `x` position refers\n            to the distance from the left of the plotting area in\n            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the\n            left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by\n            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves\n            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in\n            fractions of the domain length from the left of the\n            domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the\n            domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5\n            refers to the point between the left and the right of\n            the domain of the second x axis.\n        xsizemode\n            Sets the shapes\'s sizing mode along the x axis. If set\n            to "scaled", `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path`\n            refer to data values on the x axis or a fraction of the\n            plot area\'s width (`xref` set to "paper"). If set to\n            "pixel", `xanchor` specifies the x position in terms of\n            data or plot fraction but `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates\n            within `path` are pixels relative to `xanchor`. This\n            way, the shape can have a fixed width while maintaining\n            a position relative to data or plot fraction.\n        y0\n            Sets the shape\'s starting y position. See `type` and\n            `ysizemode` for more info.\n        y1\n            Sets the shape\'s end y position. See `type` and\n            `ysizemode` for more info.\n        yanchor\n            Only relevant in conjunction with `ysizemode` set to\n            "pixel". Specifies the anchor point on the y axis to\n            which `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path` are\n            relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape\n            to a certain data value. No effect when `ysizemode` not\n            set to "pixel".\n        yref\n            Sets the shape\'s y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis\n            id (e.g. "y" or "y2"), the `y` position refers to a y\n            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `y` position refers\n            to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in\n            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the\n            bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by\n            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves\n            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in\n            fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the\n            domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the\n            domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5\n            refers to the point between the bottom and the top of\n            the domain of the second y axis.\n        ysizemode\n            Sets the shapes\'s sizing mode along the y axis. If set\n            to "scaled", `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path`\n            refer to data values on the y axis or a fraction of the\n            plot area\'s height (`yref` set to "paper"). If set to\n            "pixel", `yanchor` specifies the y position in terms of\n            data or plot fraction but `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates\n            within `path` are pixels relative to `yanchor`. This\n            way, the shape can have a fixed height while\n            maintaining a position relative to data or plot\n            fraction.\n        row\n            Subplot row for shape.
