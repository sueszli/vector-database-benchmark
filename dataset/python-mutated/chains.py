    'Returns the chain decomposition of a graph.\n\n    The *chain decomposition* of a graph with respect a depth-first\n    search tree is a set of cycles or paths derived from the set of\n    fundamental cycles of the tree in the following manner. Consider\n    each fundamental cycle with respect to the given tree, represented\n    as a list of edges beginning with the nontree edge oriented away\n    from the root of the tree. For each fundamental cycle, if it\n    overlaps with any previous fundamental cycle, just take the initial\n    non-overlapping segment, which is a path instead of a cycle. Each\n    cycle or path is called a *chain*. For more information, see [1]_.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G : undirected graph\n\n    root : node (optional)\n       A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the chain\n       decomposition for the connected component containing this node\n       will be returned. This node indicates the root of the depth-first\n       search tree.\n\n    Yields\n    ------\n    chain : list\n       A list of edges representing a chain. There is no guarantee on\n       the orientation of the edges in each chain (for example, if a\n       chain includes the edge joining nodes 1 and 2, the chain may\n       include either (1, 2) or (2, 1)).\n\n    Raises\n    ------\n    NodeNotFound\n       If `root` is not in the graph `G`.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])\n    >>> list(nx.chain_decomposition(G))\n    [[(4, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4)]]\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The worst-case running time of this implementation is linear in the\n    number of nodes and number of edges [1]_.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
