This algorithm is based on level sets\n    that are evolved iteratively to minimize an energy, which is\n    defined by weighted values corresponding to the sum of differences\n    intensity from the average value outside the segmented region, the\n    sum of differences from the average value inside the segmented\n    region, and a term which is dependent on the length of the\n    boundary of the segmented region.\n\n    This algorithm was first proposed by Tony Chan and Luminita Vese,\n    in a publication entitled \"An Active Contour Model Without Edges\"\n    [1]_.\n\n    This implementation of the algorithm is somewhat simplified in the\n    sense that the area factor 'nu' described in the original paper is\n    not implemented, and is only suitable for grayscale images.\n\n    Typical values for `lambda1` and `lambda2` are 1. If the\n    'background' is very different from the segmented object in terms\n    of distribution (for example, a uniform black image with figures\n    of varying intensity), then these values should be different from\n    each other.\n\n    Typical values for mu are between 0 and 1, though higher values\n    can be used when dealing with shapes with very ill-defined\n    contours.\n\n    The 'energy' which this algorithm tries to minimize is defined\n    as the sum of the differences from the average within the region\n    squared and weighed by the 'lambda' factors to which is added the\n    length of the contour multiplied by the 'mu' factor.\n\n    Supports 2D grayscale images only, and does not implement the area\n    term described in the original article.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
