    Smoothing Moving Average used by Wilder in his 1978 book `New Concepts in
    Technical Trading`

    Defined in his book originally as:

      - new_value = (old_value * (period - 1) + new_data) / period

    Can be expressed as a SmoothingMovingAverage with the following factors:

      - self.smfactor -> 1.0 / period
      - self.smfactor1 -> `1.0 - self.smfactor`

    Formula:
      - movav = prev * (1.0 - smoothfactor) + newdata * smoothfactor
