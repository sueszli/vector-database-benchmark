The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov\n    equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion\n    of a discounting function.\n\n    For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this\n    method is:\n\n    ```None\n      V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +\n        (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0\n    ```\n\n    In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,\n    `V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the\n    (mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `mu_i` is the\n    drift of this process and `D_{ij}` are the components of the diffusion\n    tensor:\n\n    ```None\n      D_{ij}(t,x) = (Sigma(t,x) . Transpose[Sigma(t,x)])_{ij}\n    ```\n\n    This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from\n    time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).\n    The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional\n    rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described\n    by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,\n    a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian\n    product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with\n    coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.\n\n    This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means\n    the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`\n    (e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified\n    by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a\n    `Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th\n    axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:\n    [K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires\n    that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape\n    [K, d1, ... dn].\n\n    The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by\n    discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along\n    the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a\n    (sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the\n    time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time\n    step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of\n    steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the\n    `time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need\n    discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument\n    may not be applicable to some implementations.\n\n    The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used\n    methods, see functions in `math.pde.steppers` module.\n\n    The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above\n    equation are described in the Args section below.\n\n    For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see\n    `models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_backward`.\n\n    # TODO(b/142309558): Complete documentation.\n\n    Args:\n      start_time: Real positive scalar `Tensor`. The start time of the grid.\n        Corresponds to time `t0` above.\n      end_time: Real scalar `Tensor` smaller than the `start_time` and greater\n        than zero. The time to step back to. Corresponds to time `t1` above.\n      coord_grid: List of `n` rank 1 real `Tensor`s. `n` is the dimension of the\n        domain. The i-th `Tensor` has shape, `[d_i]` where `d_i` is the size of\n        the grid along axis `i`. The coordinates of the grid points. Corresponds\n        to the spatial grid `G` above.\n      values_grid: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time\n        `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape\n        of the `Tensor` must broadcast with `[K, d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. The first\n        axis of size `K` is the values batch dimension and allows multiple\n        functions (with potentially different boundary/final conditions) to be\n        stepped back simultaneously.\n      discounting: Callable corresponding to `r(t,x)` above. If not supplied,\n        zero discounting is assumed.\n      one_step_fn: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following\n        arguments by keyword:\n          1. 'time': Current time\n          2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time\n            evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.\n          3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.\n          4. 'values_grid': The values grid.\n          5. 'boundary_conditions': The boundary conditions.\n          6. 'quadratic_coeff': A callable returning the quadratic coefficients\n            of the PDE (i.e. `(1/2)D_{ij}(t, x)` above). The callable accepts\n            the time and  coordinate grid as keyword arguments and returns a\n            `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts with `[dim, dim]`.\n          7. 'linear_coeff': A callable returning the linear coefficients of the\n            PDE (i.e. `mu_i(t, x)` above). Accepts time and coordinate grid as\n            keyword arguments and returns a `Tensor` with shape that broadcasts\n            with `[dim]`.\n          8. 'constant_coeff': A callable returning the coefficient of the\n            linear homogeneous term (i.e. `r(t,x)` above). Same spec as above.\n            The `one_step_fn` callable returns a 2-tuple containing the next\n            coordinate grid, next values grid.\n      boundary_conditions: A list of size `dim` containing boundary conditions.\n        The i'th element of the list is a 2-tuple containing the lower and upper\n        boundary condition for the boundary along the i`th axis.\n      start_step_count: Scalar integer `Tensor`. Initial value for the number of\n        time steps performed.\n        Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).\n      num_steps: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take\n        when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the\n        `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is\n        `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the\n        solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter\n        above.\n      time_step: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`\n        argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may\n        be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case\n          `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The\n          maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then\n          the total number of steps taken is N = (t0 - t1) / dt rounded up to\n          the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last\n          step is of size `t0 - t1 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the\n          current time and returning the size of the step to take.

A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described\\n    by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,\\n    a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian\\n    product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with\\n    coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ...

In this context, batching means\\n    the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`\\n    (e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified\\n    by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a\\n    `Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th\\n    axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:\\n    [K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires\\n    that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape\\n    [K, d1, ... dn].\\n\\n    The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by\\n    discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along\\n    the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a\\n    (sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the\\n    time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`.

The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov\\n    equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion\\n    of a discounting function.\\n\\n    For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this\\n    method is:\\n\\n    ```None\\n      V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +\\n        (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0\\n    ```\\n\\n    In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,\\n    `V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the\\n    (mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `mu_i` is the\\n    drift of this process and `D_{ij}` are the components of the diffusion\\n    tensor:\\n\\n    ```None\\n      D_{ij}(t,x) = (Sigma(t,x) . Transpose[Sigma(t,x)])_{ij}\\n    ```\\n\\n    This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from\\n    time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).\\n    The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional\\n    rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described\\n    by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,\\n    a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian\\n    product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with\\n    coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.\\n\\n    This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means\\n    the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`\\n    (e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified\\n    by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a\\n    `Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th\\n    axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:\\n    [K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires\\n    that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape\\n    [K, d1, ... dn].\\n\\n    The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by\\n    discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along\\n    the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a\\n    (sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the\\n    time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time\\n    step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of\\n    steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the\\n    `time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need\\n    discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument\\n    may not be applicable to some implementations.\\n\\n    The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`.

Initial value for the number of\\n        time steps performed.\\n        Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).\\n      num_steps: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take\\n        when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the\\n        `time_step` argument must be supplied (but not both). If num steps is\\n        `k>=1`, uniform time steps of size `(t0 - t1)/k` are taken to evolve the\\n        solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter\\n        above.\\n      time_step: The time step to take. Either this argument or the `num_steps`\\n        argument must be supplied (but not both). The type of this argument may\\n        be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case\\n          `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The\\n          maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then\\n          the total number of steps taken is N = (t1 - t0) / dt rounded up to\\n          the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last\\n          step is of size `t1 - t0 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the\\n          current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and\\n          the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.\\n      values_transform_fn: An optional callable applied to transform the\\n        solution values at each time step. The callable is invoked after the\\n        time step has been performed. The callable should accept the time of the\\n        grid, the coordinate grid and the values grid and should return the\\n        values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.\\n      dtype: The dtype to use.\\n      name: The name to give to the ops.\\n        Default value: None which means `solve_forward` is used.\\n      **kwargs: Additional keyword args:\\n        (1) pde_solver_fn: Function to solve the PDE that accepts all the above\\n          arguments by name and returns the same tuple object as required below.\\n          Defaults to `tff.math.pde.fd_solvers.solve_forward`.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n      A tuple object containing at least the following attributes:\\n        final_values_grid: A `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `values_grid`.\\n          Contains the final state of the values grid at time `end_time`.\\n        final_coord_grid: A list of `Tensor`s of the same specification as\\n          the input `coord_grid`. Final state of the coordinate grid at time\\n          `end_time`.\\n        step_count: The total step count (i.e. the sum of the `start_step_count`\\n          and the number of steps performed in this call.).\\n        final_time: The final time at which the evolution stopped. This value\\n          is given by `max(min(end_time, start_time), 0)`.\\n    \"\n    pde_solver_fn = kwargs.get('pde_solver_fn', fd_solvers.solve_forward)\n    (backward_second_order, backward_first_order, backward_zeroth_order) = _backward_pde_coeffs(self._drift_fn, self._volatility_fn, discounting=None)\n    inner_second_order_coeff_fn = lambda t, x: -backward_second_order(t, x)\n    inner_first_order_coeff_fn = backward_first_order\n    zeroth_order_coeff_fn = backward_zeroth_order\n    return pde_solver_fn(start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, coord_grid=coord_grid, values_grid=values_grid, num_steps=num_steps, start_step_count=start_step_count, time_step=time_step, one_step_fn=one_step_fn, boundary_conditions=boundary_conditions, values_transform_fn=values_transform_fn, inner_second_order_coeff_fn=inner_second_order_coeff_fn, inner_first_order_coeff_fn=inner_first_order_coeff_fn, zeroth_order_coeff_fn=zeroth_order_coeff_fn, dtype=dtype, name=name)"
