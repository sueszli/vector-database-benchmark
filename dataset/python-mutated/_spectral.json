If `None`,\n        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`. When\n        specified, the COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below).\n    nfft : int, optional\n        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If\n        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.\n    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional\n        Specifies how to detrend each segment.

This has the benefit\n        of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the\n        employed window function starts at zero.

Defaults to `True`, but for\\n        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.\\n    boundary : str or None, optional\\n        Specifies whether the input signal is extended at both ends, and\\n        how to generate the new values, in order to center the first\\n        windowed segment on the first input point. This has the benefit\\n        of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the\\n        employed window function starts at zero. Valid options are\\n        ``[\\'even\\', \\'odd\\', \\'constant\\', \\'zeros\\', None]``. Defaults to\\n        \\'zeros\\', for zero padding extension.

Padding occurs after boundary extension, if\\n        `boundary` is not `None`, and `padded` is `True`, as is the\\n        default.\\n    axis : int, optional\\n        Axis along which the STFT is computed; the default is over the\\n        last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).\\n    scaling: {\\'spectrum\\', \\'psd\\'}\\n        The default \\'spectrum\\' scaling allows each frequency line of `Zxx` to\\n        be interpreted as a magnitude spectrum. The \\'psd\\' option scales each\\n        line to a power spectral density - it allows to calculate the signal\\'s\\n        energy by numerically integrating over ``abs(Zxx)**2``.\\n\\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    f : ndarray\\n        Array of sample frequencies.\\n    t : ndarray\\n        Array of segment times.\\n    Zxx : ndarray\\n        STFT of `x`.

The `padded` argument may be used to\\n    accomplish this.\\n\\n    Given a time-domain signal :math:`x[n]`, a window :math:`w[n]`, and a hop\\n    size :math:`H` = `nperseg - noverlap`, the windowed frame at time index\\n    :math:`t` is given by\\n\\n    .. math:: x_{t}[n]=x[n]w[n-tH]\\n\\n    The overlap-add (OLA) reconstruction equation is given by\\n\\n    .. math:: x[n]=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\\\\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}\\n\\n    The NOLA constraint ensures that every normalization term that appears\\n    in the denomimator of the OLA reconstruction equation is nonzero.

If `window` is a string or tuple, it is\\n        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are\\n        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and\\n        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used\\n        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg.

If `None`, the value depends on the shape of\\n        `Zxx` and `input_onesided`. If `input_onesided` is `True`,\\n        ``nperseg=2*(Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1)``.

Defaults to 1.0.\\n    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional\\n        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is\\n        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are\\n        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and\\n        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used\\n        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults\\n        to a Hann window. Must match the window used to generate the\\n        STFT for faithful inversion.\\n    nperseg : int, optional\\n        Number of data points corresponding to each STFT segment. This\\n        parameter must be specified if the number of data points per\\n        segment is odd, or if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >\\n        nperseg``. If `None`, the value depends on the shape of\\n        `Zxx` and `input_onesided`. If `input_onesided` is `True`,\\n        ``nperseg=2*(Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1)``.

This case allows the proper inversion of an\\n        odd-length unpadded STFT using ``nfft=None``.

Defaults to 1.0.\\n    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional\\n        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is\\n        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are\\n        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and\\n        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used\\n        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults\\n        to a Hann window. Must match the window used to generate the\\n        STFT for faithful inversion.\\n    nperseg : int, optional\\n        Number of data points corresponding to each STFT segment. This\\n        parameter must be specified if the number of data points per\\n        segment is odd, or if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >\\n        nperseg``. If `None`, the value depends on the shape of\\n        `Zxx` and `input_onesided`. If `input_onesided` is `True`,\\n        ``nperseg=2*(Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1)``. Otherwise,\\n        ``nperseg=Zxx.shape[freq_axis]``. Defaults to `None`.\\n    noverlap : int, optional\\n        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`, half\\n        of the segment length. Defaults to `None`. When specified, the\\n        COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below), and should match\\n        the parameter used to generate the STFT. Defaults to `None`.\\n    nfft : int, optional\\n        Number of FFT points corresponding to each STFT segment. This\\n        parameter must be specified if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >\\n        nperseg``. If `None`, the default values are the same as for\\n        `nperseg`, detailed above, with one exception: if\\n        `input_onesided` is True and\\n        ``nperseg==2*Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1``, `nfft` also takes on\\n        that value. This case allows the proper inversion of an\\n        odd-length unpadded STFT using ``nfft=None``. Defaults to\\n        `None`.\\n    input_onesided : bool, optional\\n        If `True`, interpret the input array as one-sided FFTs, such\\n        as is returned by `stft` with ``return_onesided=True`` and\\n        `numpy.fft.rfft`. If `False`, interpret the input as a\\n        two-sided FFT. Defaults to `True`.\\n    boundary : bool, optional\\n        Specifies whether the input signal was extended at its\\n        boundaries by supplying a non-`None` ``boundary`` argument to\\n        `stft`. Defaults to `True`.\\n    time_axis : int, optional\\n        Where the time segments of the STFT is located; the default is\\n        the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).\\n    freq_axis : int, optional\\n        Where the frequency axis of the STFT is located; the default is\\n        the penultimate axis (i.e. ``axis=-2``).\\n    scaling: {\\'spectrum\\', \\'psd\\'}\\n        The default \\'spectrum\\' scaling allows each frequency line of `Zxx` to\\n        be interpreted as a magnitude spectrum. The \\'psd\\' option scales each\\n        line to a power spectral density - it allows to calculate the signal\\'s\\n        energy by numerically integrating over ``abs(Zxx)**2``.\\n\\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    t : ndarray\\n        Array of output data times.\\n    x : ndarray\\n        iSTFT of `Zxx`.\\n\\n    See Also\\n    --------\\n    stft: Short Time Fourier Transform\\n    check_COLA: Check whether the Constant OverLap Add (COLA) constraint\\n                is met\\n    check_NOLA: Check whether the Nonzero Overlap Add (NOLA) constraint is met\\n\\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT with\\n    `istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of \"nonzero\\n    overlap add\" (NOLA):\\n\\n    .. math:: \\\\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH] \\\\ne 0\\n\\n    This ensures that the normalization factors that appear in the denominator\\n    of the overlap-add reconstruction equation\\n\\n    .. math:: x[n]=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\\\\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}\\n\\n    are not zero.

Defaults to None, but if window is str or\n        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the\n        length of the window.\n    noverlap : int, optional\n        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,\n        ``noverlap = nperseg // 8``. Defaults to `None`.\n    nfft : int, optional\n        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If\n        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.\n    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional\n        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a\n        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`\n        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a\n        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is\n        done. Defaults to 'constant'.\n    return_onesided : bool, optional\n        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If\n        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for\n        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.\n    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional\n        Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')\n        where `Sxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power\n        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Sxx` has units of V**2, if `x`\n        is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to\n        'density'.\n    axis : int, optional\n        Axis along which the spectrogram is computed; the default is over\n        the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).\n    mode : str, optional\n        Defines what kind of return values are expected. Options are\n        ['psd', 'complex', 'magnitude', 'angle', 'phase']. 'complex' is\n        equivalent to the output of `stft` with no padding or boundary\n        extension. 'magnitude' returns the absolute magnitude of the\n        STFT. 'angle' and 'phase' return the complex angle of the STFT,\n        with and without unwrapping, respectively.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    f : ndarray\n        Array of sample frequencies.\n    t : ndarray\n        Array of segment times.\n    Sxx : ndarray\n        Spectrogram of x.

In contrast to welch's method, where the\n    entire data stream is averaged over, one may wish to use a smaller\n    overlap (or perhaps none at all) when computing a spectrogram, to\n    maintain some statistical independence between individual segments.\n    It is for this reason that the default window is a Tukey window with\n    1/8th of a window's length overlap at each end.
