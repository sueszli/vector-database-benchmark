Since `milp` requires\n    that the problem be expressed as a minimization problem, the objective\n    function coefficients on the decision variables are:\n\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> c = -np.array([0, 1])\n\n    Note the negative sign: we maximize the original objective function\n    by minimizing the negative of the objective function.\n\n    We collect the coefficients of the constraints into arrays like:\n\n    >>> A = np.array([[-1, 1], [3, 2], [2, 3]])\n    >>> b_u = np.array([1, 12, 12])\n    >>> b_l = np.full_like(b_u, -np.inf)\n\n    Because there is no lower limit on these constraints, we have defined a\n    variable ``b_l`` full of values representing negative infinity. This may\n    be unfamiliar to users of `scipy.optimize.linprog`, which only accepts\n    \"less than\" (or \"upper bound\") inequality constraints of the form\n    ``A_ub @ x <= b_u``. By accepting both ``b_l`` and ``b_u`` of constraints\n    ``b_l <= A_ub @ x <= b_u``, `milp` makes it easy to specify \"greater than\"\n    inequality constraints, \"less than\" inequality constraints, and equality\n    constraints concisely.\n\n    These arrays are collected into a single `LinearConstraint` object like:\n\n    >>> from scipy.optimize import LinearConstraint\n    >>> constraints = LinearConstraint(A, b_l, b_u)\n\n    The non-negativity bounds on the decision variables are enforced by\n    default, so we do not need to provide an argument for `bounds`.\n\n    Finally, the problem states that both decision variables must be integers:\n\n    >>> integrality = np.ones_like(c)\n\n    We solve the problem like:\n\n    >>> from scipy.optimize import milp\n    >>> res = milp(c=c, constraints=constraints, integrality=integrality)\n    >>> res.x\n    [1.0, 2.0]\n\n    Note that had we solved the relaxed problem (without integrality\n    constraints):\n\n    >>> res = milp(c=c, constraints=constraints)  # OR:\n    >>> # from scipy.optimize import linprog; res = linprog(c, A, b_u)\n    >>> res.x\n    [1.8, 2.8]\n\n    we would not have obtained the correct solution by rounding to the nearest\n    integers.\n\n    Other examples are given :ref:`in the tutorial <tutorial-optimize_milp>`.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    args_iv = _milp_iv(c, integrality, bounds, constraints, options)\n    (c, integrality, lb, ub, indptr, indices, data, b_l, b_u, options) = args_iv\n    highs_res = _highs_wrapper(c, indptr, indices, data, b_l, b_u, lb, ub, integrality, options)\n    res = {}\n    highs_status = highs_res.get('status', None)\n    highs_message = highs_res.get('message', None)\n    (status, message) = _highs_to_scipy_status_message(highs_status, highs_message)\n    res['status'] = status\n    res['message'] = message\n    res['success'] = status == 0\n    x = highs_res.get('x', None)\n    res['x'] = np.array(x) if x is not None else None\n    res['fun'] = highs_res.get('fun', None)\n    res['mip_node_count'] = highs_res.get('mip_node_count', None)\n    res['mip_dual_bound'] = highs_res.get('mip_dual_bound', None)\n    res['mip_gap'] = highs_res.get('mip_gap', None)\n    return OptimizeResult(res)",
