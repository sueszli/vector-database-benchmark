Can be used with `pattern`.\n            dvalue\n                Sets the size of each `values` item. The\n                default is one day in milliseconds.\n            enabled\n                Determines whether this axis rangebreak is\n                enabled or disabled. Please note that\n                `rangebreaks` only work for "date" axis type.\n            name\n                When used in a template, named items are\n                created in the output figure in addition to any\n                items the figure already has in this array. You\n                can modify these items in the output figure by\n                making your own item with `templateitemname`\n                matching this `name` alongside your\n                modifications (including `visible: false` or\n                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect\n                outside of a template.\n            pattern\n                Determines a pattern on the time line that\n                generates breaks. If *day of week* - days of\n                the week in English e.g. \'Sunday\' or `sun`\n                (matching is case-insensitive and considers\n                only the first three characters), as well as\n                Sunday-based integers between 0 and 6. If\n                "hour" - hour (24-hour clock) as decimal\n                numbers between 0 and 24. for more info.\n                Examples: - { pattern: \'day of week\', bounds:\n                [6, 1] }  or simply { bounds: [\'sat\', \'mon\'] }\n                breaks from Saturday to Monday (i.e. skips the\n                weekends). - { pattern: \'hour\', bounds: [17, 8]\n                }   breaks from 5pm to 8am (i.e. skips non-work\n                hours).\n            templateitemname\n                Used to refer to a named item in this array in\n                the template. Named items from the template\n                will be created even without a matching item in\n                the input figure, but you can modify one by\n                making an item with `templateitemname` matching\n                its `name`, alongside your modifications\n                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false`\n                to hide it). If there is no template or no\n                matching item, this item will be hidden unless\n                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`.\n            values\n                Sets the coordinate values corresponding to the\n                rangebreaks. An alternative to `bounds`. Use\n                `dvalue` to set the size of the values along\n                the axis.\n'), **kwargs)
