Default is 0.\n    method : {\'auto\', \'asymptotic\', \'exact\'}, optional\n        Selects the method used to calculate the *p*-value.\n        Default is \'auto\'.

No correction is made for ties.\n        * ``\'auto\'``: chooses ``\'exact\'`` when the size of one of the samples\n          is less than or equal to 8 and there are no ties;\n          chooses ``\'asymptotic\'`` otherwise.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    res : MannwhitneyuResult\n        An object containing attributes:\n\n        statistic : float\n            The Mann-Whitney U statistic corresponding with sample `x`.

For related / paired samples,\n    consider `scipy.stats.wilcoxon`.\n\n    `method` ``\'exact\'`` is recommended when there are no ties and when either\n    sample size is less than 8 [1]_. The implementation follows the recurrence\n    relation originally proposed in [1]_ as it is described in [3]_.\n    Note that the exact method is *not* corrected for ties, but\n    `mannwhitneyu` will not raise errors or warnings if there are ties in the\n    data.\n\n    The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric version of the t-test for\n    independent samples. When the means of samples from the populations\n    are normally distributed, consider `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    scipy.stats.wilcoxon, scipy.stats.ranksums, scipy.stats.ttest_ind\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..

We decide\n    that a confidence level of 95% is required to reject the null hypothesis\n    in favor of the alternative that the distributions are different.\n    Since the number of samples is very small and there are no ties in the\n    data, we can compare the observed test statistic against the *exact*\n    distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\n\n    >>> from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu\n    >>> U1, p = mannwhitneyu(males, females, method="exact")\n    >>> print(U1)\n    17.0\n\n    `mannwhitneyu` always reports the statistic associated with the first\n    sample, which, in this case, is males. This agrees with :math:`U_M = 17`\n    reported in [4]_. The statistic associated with the second statistic\n    can be calculated:\n\n    >>> nx, ny = len(males), len(females)\n    >>> U2 = nx*ny - U1\n    >>> print(U2)\n    3.0\n\n    This agrees with :math:`U_F = 3` reported in [4]_. The two-sided\n    *p*-value can be calculated from either statistic, and the value produced\n    by `mannwhitneyu` agrees with :math:`p = 0.11` reported in [4]_.\n\n    >>> print(p)\n    0.1111111111111111\n\n    The exact distribution of the test statistic is asymptotically normal, so\n    the example continues by comparing the exact *p*-value against the\n    *p*-value produced using the normal approximation.\n\n    >>> _, pnorm = mannwhitneyu(males, females, method="asymptotic")\n    >>> print(pnorm)\n    0.11134688653314041\n\n    Here `mannwhitneyu`\'s reported *p*-value appears to conflict with the\n    value :math:`p = 0.09` given in [4]_. The reason is that [4]_\n    does not apply the continuity correction performed by `mannwhitneyu`;\n    `mannwhitneyu` reduces the distance between the test statistic and the\n    mean :math:`\\mu = n_x n_y / 2` by 0.5 to correct for the fact that the\n    discrete statistic is being compared against a continuous distribution.\n    Here, the :math:`U` statistic used is less than the mean, so we reduce\n    the distance by adding 0.5 in the numerator.\n\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> from scipy.stats import norm\n    >>> U = min(U1, U2)\n    >>> N = nx + ny\n    >>> z = (U - nx*ny/2 + 0.5) / np.sqrt(nx*ny * (N + 1)/ 12)\n    >>> p = 2 * norm.cdf(z)  # use CDF to get p-value from smaller statistic\n    >>> print(p)\n    0.11134688653314041\n\n    If desired, we can disable the continuity correction to get a result\n    that agrees with that reported in [4]_.\n\n    >>> _, pnorm = mannwhitneyu(males, females, use_continuity=False,\n    ...                         method="asymptotic")\n    >>> print(pnorm)\n    0.0864107329737\n\n    Regardless of whether we perform an exact or asymptotic test, the\n    probability of the test statistic being as extreme or more extreme by\n    chance exceeds 5%, so we do not consider the results statistically\n    significant.\n\n    Suppose that, before seeing the data, we had hypothesized that females\n    would tend to be diagnosed at a younger age than males.\n    In that case, it would be natural to provide the female ages as the\n    first input, and we would have performed a one-sided test using\n    ``alternative = \'less\'``: females are diagnosed at an age that is\n    stochastically less than that of males.\n\n    >>> res = mannwhitneyu(females, males, alternative="less", method="exact")\n    >>> print(res)\n    MannwhitneyuResult(statistic=3.0, pvalue=0.05555555555555555)\n\n    Again, the probability of getting a sufficiently low value of the\n    test statistic by chance under the null hypothesis is greater than 5%,\n    so we do not reject the null hypothesis in favor of our alternative.\n\n    If it is reasonable to assume that the means of samples from the\n    populations are normally distributed, we could have used a t-test to\n    perform the analysis.\n\n    >>> from scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n    >>> res = ttest_ind(females, males, alternative="less")\n    >>> print(res)\n    Ttest_indResult(statistic=-2.239334696520584, pvalue=0.030068441095757924)\n\n    Under this assumption, the *p*-value would be low enough to reject the\n    null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n\n    '
