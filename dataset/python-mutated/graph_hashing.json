Thus, each list will contain\n    ``iterations + 1`` elements - a hash for a subgraph at each depth, and\n    additionally a hash of the initial node label (or equivalently a\n    subgraph of depth 0)\n\n    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighbourhoods of each node.\n    This is achieved for each step by replacing for each node its label from\n    the previous iteration with its hashed 1-hop neighborhood aggregate.\n    The new node label is then appended to a list of node labels for each\n    node.\n\n    To aggregate neighborhoods at each step for a node $n$, all labels of\n    nodes adjacent to $n$ are concatenated. If the `edge_attr` parameter is set,\n    labels for each neighboring node are prefixed with the value of this attribute\n    along the connecting edge from this neighbor to node $n$. The resulting string\n    is then hashed to compress this information into a fixed digest size.\n\n    Thus, at the $i$-th iteration, nodes within $i$ hops influence any given\n    hashed node label. We can therefore say that at depth $i$ for node $n$\n    we have a hash for a subgraph induced by the $2i$-hop neighborhood of $n$.\n\n    The output can be used to to create general Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels,\n    or generate features for graphs or nodes - for example to generate 'words' in\n    a graph as seen in the 'graph2vec' algorithm.\n    See [1]_ & [2]_ respectively for details.\n\n    Hashes are identical for isomorphic subgraphs and there exist strong\n    guarantees that non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes.\n    See [1]_ for details.\n\n    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node\n    is used as its initial label.\n    Otherwise, node and/or edge labels are used to compute the hash.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G: graph\n        The graph to be hashed.\n        Can have node and/or edge attributes.

From this we can conclude that it's very\n    likely the neighborhood of 4 hops around these nodes are isomorphic: each\n    iteration aggregates 1-hop neighbourhoods meaning hashes at depth $n$ are influenced\n    by every node within $2n$ hops.\n\n    However the neighborhood of 6 hops is no longer isomorphic since their 3rd hash does\n    not match.\n\n    These nodes may be candidates to be classified together since their local topology\n    is similar.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    To hash the full graph when subgraph hashes are not needed, use\n    `weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash` for efficiency.\n\n    Similarity between hashes does not imply similarity between graphs.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
