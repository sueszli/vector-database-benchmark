"""
The Legality Principle is a language agnostic principle maintaining that syllable
onsets and codas (the beginning and ends of syllables not including the vowel)
are only legal if they are found as word onsets or codas in the language. The English
word ''admit'' must then be syllabified as ''ad-mit'' since ''dm'' is not found
word-initially in the English language (Bartlett et al.). This principle was first proposed
in Daniel Kahn's 1976 dissertation, ''Syllable-based generalizations in English phonology''.

Kahn further argues that there is a ''strong tendency to syllabify in such a way that
initial clusters are of maximal length, consistent with the general constraints on
word-initial consonant clusters.'' Consequently, in addition to being legal onsets,
the longest legal onset is preferable---''Onset Maximization''.

The default implementation assumes an English vowel set, but the `vowels` attribute
can be set to IPA or any other alphabet's vowel set for the use-case.
Both a valid set of vowels as well as a text corpus of words in the language
are necessary to determine legal onsets and subsequently syllabify words.

The legality principle with onset maximization is a universal syllabification algorithm,
but that does not mean it performs equally across languages. Bartlett et al. (2009)
is a good benchmark for English accuracy if utilizing IPA (pg. 311).
