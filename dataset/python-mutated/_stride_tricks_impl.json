That means that the sliding window variant\n    for a window size of 100 can be a 100 times slower than a more specialized\n    version.\n\n    Nevertheless, for small window sizes, when no custom algorithm exists, or\n    as a prototyping and developing tool, this function can be a good solution.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> x = np.arange(6)\n    >>> x.shape\n    (6,)\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)\n    >>> v.shape\n    (4, 3)\n    >>> v\n    array([[0, 1, 2],\n           [1, 2, 3],\n           [2, 3, 4],\n           [3, 4, 5]])\n\n    This also works in more dimensions, e.g.\n\n    >>> i, j = np.ogrid[:3, :4]\n    >>> x = 10*i + j\n    >>> x.shape\n    (3, 4)\n    >>> x\n    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\n           [10, 11, 12, 13],\n           [20, 21, 22, 23]])\n    >>> shape = (2,2)\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, shape)\n    >>> v.shape\n    (2, 3, 2, 2)\n    >>> v\n    array([[[[ 0,  1],\n             [10, 11]],\n            [[ 1,  2],\n             [11, 12]],\n            [[ 2,  3],\n             [12, 13]]],\n           [[[10, 11],\n             [20, 21]],\n            [[11, 12],\n             [21, 22]],\n            [[12, 13],\n             [22, 23]]]])\n\n    The axis can be specified explicitly:\n\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, 0)\n    >>> v.shape\n    (1, 4, 3)\n    >>> v\n    array([[[ 0, 10, 20],\n            [ 1, 11, 21],\n            [ 2, 12, 22],\n            [ 3, 13, 23]]])\n\n    The same axis can be used several times. In that case, every use reduces\n    the corresponding original dimension:\n\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, (2, 3), (1, 1))\n    >>> v.shape\n    (3, 1, 2, 3)\n    >>> v\n    array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],\n             [ 1,  2,  3]]],\n           [[[10, 11, 12],\n             [11, 12, 13]]],\n           [[[20, 21, 22],\n             [21, 22, 23]]]])\n\n    Combining with stepped slicing (`::step`), this can be used to take sliding\n    views which skip elements:\n\n    >>> x = np.arange(7)\n    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 5)[:, ::2]\n    array([[0, 2, 4],\n           [1, 3, 5],\n           [2, 4, 6]])\n\n    or views which move by multiple elements\n\n    >>> x = np.arange(7)\n    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 3)[::2, :]\n    array([[0, 1, 2],\n           [2, 3, 4],\n           [4, 5, 6]])\n\n    A common application of `sliding_window_view` is the calculation of running\n    statistics.

Often specialized solutions exist, for example:\\n\\n    - `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`\\n\\n    - filtering functions in `scipy.ndimage`\\n\\n    - moving window functions provided by\\n      `bottleneck <https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck>`_.\\n\\n    As a rough estimate, a sliding window approach with an input size of `N`\\n    and a window size of `W` will scale as `O(N*W)` where frequently a special\\n    algorithm can achieve `O(N)`. That means that the sliding window variant\\n    for a window size of 100 can be a 100 times slower than a more specialized\\n    version.\\n\\n    Nevertheless, for small window sizes, when no custom algorithm exists, or\\n    as a prototyping and developing tool, this function can be a good solution.\\n\\n    Examples\\n    --------\\n    >>> x = np.arange(6)\\n    >>> x.shape\\n    (6,)\\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)\\n    >>> v.shape\\n    (4, 3)\\n    >>> v\\n    array([[0, 1, 2],\\n           [1, 2, 3],\\n           [2, 3, 4],\\n           [3, 4, 5]])\\n\\n    This also works in more dimensions, e.g.\\n\\n    >>> i, j = np.ogrid[:3, :4]\\n    >>> x = 10*i + j\\n    >>> x.shape\\n    (3, 4)\\n    >>> x\\n    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\\n           [10, 11, 12, 13],\\n           [20, 21, 22, 23]])\\n    >>> shape = (2,2)\\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, shape)\\n    >>> v.shape\\n    (2, 3, 2, 2)\\n    >>> v\\n    array([[[[ 0,  1],\\n             [10, 11]],\\n            [[ 1,  2],\\n             [11, 12]],\\n            [[ 2,  3],\\n             [12, 13]]],\\n           [[[10, 11],\\n             [20, 21]],\\n            [[11, 12],\\n             [21, 22]],\\n            [[12, 13],\\n             [22, 23]]]])\\n\\n    The axis can be specified explicitly:\\n\\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, 0)\\n    >>> v.shape\\n    (1, 4, 3)\\n    >>> v\\n    array([[[ 0, 10, 20],\\n            [ 1, 11, 21],\\n            [ 2, 12, 22],\\n            [ 3, 13, 23]]])\\n\\n    The same axis can be used several times. In that case, every use reduces\\n    the corresponding original dimension:\\n\\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, (2, 3), (1, 1))\\n    >>> v.shape\\n    (3, 1, 2, 3)\\n    >>> v\\n    array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],\\n             [ 1,  2,  3]]],\\n           [[[10, 11, 12],\\n             [11, 12, 13]]],\\n           [[[20, 21, 22],\\n             [21, 22, 23]]]])\\n\\n    Combining with stepped slicing (`::step`), this can be used to take sliding\\n    views which skip elements:\\n\\n    >>> x = np.arange(7)\\n    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 5)[:, ::2]\\n    array([[0, 2, 4],\\n           [1, 3, 5],\\n           [2, 4, 6]])\\n\\n    or views which move by multiple elements\\n\\n    >>> x = np.arange(7)\\n    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 3)[::2, :]\\n    array([[0, 1, 2],\\n           [2, 3, 4],\\n           [4, 5, 6]])\\n\\n    A common application of `sliding_window_view` is the calculation of running\\n    statistics. The simplest example is the\\n    `moving average <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`_:\\n\\n    >>> x = np.arange(6)\\n    >>> x.shape\\n    (6,)\\n    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)\\n    >>> v.shape\\n    (4, 3)\\n    >>> v\\n    array([[0, 1, 2],\\n           [1, 2, 3],\\n           [2, 3, 4],\\n           [3, 4, 5]])\\n    >>> moving_average = v.mean(axis=-1)\\n    >>> moving_average\\n    array([1., 2., 3., 4.])\\n\\n    Note that a sliding window approach is often **not** optimal (see Notes).\\n    '\n    window_shape = tuple(window_shape) if np.iterable(window_shape) else (window_shape,)\n    x = np.array(x, copy=False, subok=subok)\n    window_shape_array = np.array(window_shape)\n    if np.any(window_shape_array < 0):\n        raise ValueError('`window_shape` cannot contain negative values')\n    if axis is None:\n        axis = tuple(range(x.ndim))\n        if len(window_shape) != len(axis):\n            raise ValueError(f'Since axis is `None`, must provide window_shape for all dimensions of `x`; got {len(window_shape)} window_shape elements and `x.ndim` is {x.ndim}.')\n    else:\n        axis = normalize_axis_tuple(axis, x.ndim, allow_duplicate=True)\n        if len(window_shape) != len(axis):\n            raise ValueError(f'Must provide matching length window_shape and axis; got {len(window_shape)} window_shape elements and {len(axis)} axes elements.')\n    out_strides = x.strides + tuple((x.strides[ax] for ax in axis))\n    x_shape_trimmed = list(x.shape)\n    for (ax, dim) in zip(axis, window_shape):\n        if x_shape_trimmed[ax] < dim:\n            raise ValueError('window shape cannot be larger than input array shape')\n        x_shape_trimmed[ax] -= dim - 1\n    out_shape = tuple(x_shape_trimmed) + window_shape\n    return as_strided(x, strides=out_strides, shape=out_shape, subok=subok, writeable=writeable)"
