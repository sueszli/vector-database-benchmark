(b) A real `Tensor` of shape `[dim]`. This\\n        corresponds to a time independent drift with the `i`th component as the\\n        drift rate of the `i`th component of the Brownian motion. (c) A Python\\n        callable accepting a single positive `Tensor` of general shape (referred\\n        to as `times_shape`) and returning a `Tensor` of shape `times_shape +\\n        [dim]`. The input argument is the times at which the drift needs to be\\n        evaluated. This case corresponds to a general time and direction\\n        dependent drift rate.\\n        Default value: None which maps to zero drift.\\n      volatility: The volatility of the process. The type and shape of the\\n        supplied value must be one of the following (in increasing order of\\n        generality) (a) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. This corresponds to a\\n        time independent, diagonal volatility matrix. The `(i, j)` component of\\n        the full volatility matrix is equal to zero if `i != j` and equal to the\\n        supplied value otherwise. (b) A positive real `Tensor` of shape `[dim]`.\\n        This corresponds to a time independent volatility matrix with zero\\n        correlation. The `(i, j)` component of the full volatility matrix is\\n        equal to zero `i != j` and equal to the `i`th component of the supplied\\n        value otherwise. (c) A positive definite real `Tensor` of shape `[dim,\\n        dim]`. The full time independent volatility matrix. (d) A Python\\n        callable accepting a single positive `Tensor` of general shape (referred\\n        to as `times_shape`) and returning a `Tensor` of shape `times_shape +\\n        [dim, dim]`. The input argument are the times at which the volatility\\n        needs to be evaluated. This case corresponds to a general time and axis\\n        dependent volatility matrix.\\n        Default value: None which maps to a volatility matrix equal to identity.\\n      total_drift_fn: Optional Python callable to compute the integrated drift\\n        rate between two times. The callable should accept two real `Tensor`\\n        arguments. The first argument contains the start times and the second,\\n        the end times of the time intervals for which the total drift is to be\\n        computed. Both the `Tensor` arguments are of the same dtype and shape.\\n        The return value of the callable should be a real `Tensor` of the same\\n        dtype as the input arguments and of shape `times_shape + [dim]` where\\n        `times_shape` is the shape of the times `Tensor`. Note that it is an\\n        error to supply this parameter if the `drift` is not supplied.\\n        Default value: None.\\n      total_covariance_fn: A Python callable returning the integrated covariance\\n        rate between two times. The callable should accept two real `Tensor`\\n        arguments. The first argument is the start times and the second is the\\n        end times of the time intervals for which the total covariance is\\n        needed. Both the `Tensor` arguments are of the same dtype and shape. The\\n        return value of the callable is a real `Tensor` of the same dtype as the\\n        input arguments and of shape `times_shape + [dim, dim]` where\\n        `times_shape` is the shape of the times `Tensor`. Note that it is an\\n        error to supply this argument if the `volatility` is not supplied.\\n        Default value: None.\\n      dtype: The default dtype to use when converting values to `Tensor`s.\\n        Default value: None which means that default dtypes inferred by\\n          TensorFlow are used.\\n      name: str. The name scope under which ops created by the methods of this\\n        class are nested.\\n        Default value: None which maps to the default name `brownian_motion`.\\n\\n    Raises:\\n      ValueError if the dimension is less than 1 or if total drift is supplied\\n        but drift is not supplied or if the total covariance is supplied but\\n        but volatility is not supplied.\\n    '\n    super(BrownianMotion, self).__init__()\n    if dim < 1:\n        raise ValueError('Dimension must be 1 or greater.')\n    if drift is None and total_drift_fn is not None:\n        raise ValueError('total_drift_fn must not be supplied if drift is not supplied.')\n    if volatility is None and total_covariance_fn is not None:\n        raise ValueError('total_covariance_fn must not be supplied if drift is not supplied.')\n    self._dim = dim\n    self._dtype = dtype\n    self._name = name or 'brownian_motion'\n    (drift_fn, total_drift_fn) = bmu.construct_drift_data(drift, total_drift_fn, dim, dtype)\n    self._drift_fn = drift_fn\n    self._total_drift_fn = total_drift_fn\n    (vol_fn, total_covar_fn) = bmu.construct_vol_data(volatility, total_covariance_fn, dim, dtype)\n    self._volatility_fn = vol_fn\n    self._total_covariance_fn = total_covar_fn"
