Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.\nClassify the sentiment of the message: negative\n\nSomething surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month. I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it.\nClassify the sentiment of the message: positive\n\nMy family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. We have most lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I\'m not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fianc√©e\'s house. His conversation with the butler and Susan\'s father is side-spitting. The line from the butler, "Would you care to wait in the Library" followed by Arthur\'s reply, "Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer.\nClassify the sentiment of the message: positive\n\nThis Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There\'s a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. I\'m still trying to figure out why Charlie want to change his name.\nClassify the sentiment of the message: negative\n\nTweet: The Pixel 7 Pro, is too big to fit in my jeans pocket, so I bought new jeans.\nClassify the sentiment of the message: ', **parameters)
