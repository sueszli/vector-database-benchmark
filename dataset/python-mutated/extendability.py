    'Computes the extendability of a graph.\n\n    The extendability of a graph is defined as the maximum $k$ for which `G`\n    is $k$-extendable. Graph `G` is $k$-extendable if and only if `G` has a\n    perfect matching and every set of $k$ independent edges can be extended\n    to a perfect matching in `G`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G : NetworkX Graph\n        A fully-connected bipartite graph without self-loops\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    extendability : int\n\n    Raises\n    ------\n    NetworkXError\n       If the graph `G` is disconnected.\n       If the graph `G` is not bipartite.\n       If the graph `G` does not contain a perfect matching.\n       If the residual graph of `G` is not strongly connected.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Definition:\n    Let `G` be a simple, connected, undirected and bipartite graph with a perfect\n    matching M and bipartition (U,V). The residual graph of `G`, denoted by $G_M$,\n    is the graph obtained from G by directing the edges of M from V to U and the\n    edges that do not belong to M from U to V.\n\n    Lemma [1]_ :\n    Let M be a perfect matching of `G`. `G` is $k$-extendable if and only if its residual\n    graph $G_M$ is strongly connected and there are $k$ vertex-disjoint directed\n    paths between every vertex of U and every vertex of V.\n\n    Assuming that input graph `G` is undirected, simple, connected, bipartite and contains\n    a perfect matching M, this function constructs the residual graph $G_M$ of G and\n    returns the minimum value among the maximum vertex-disjoint directed paths between\n    every vertex of U and every vertex of V in $G_M$. By combining the definitions\n    and the lemma, this value represents the extendability of the graph `G`.\n\n    Time complexity O($n^3$ $m^2$)) where $n$ is the number of vertices\n    and $m$ is the number of edges.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
