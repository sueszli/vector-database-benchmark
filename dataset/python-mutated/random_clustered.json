According to this list,\\n    vertex $u$ is a member of $d_{u,t}$ triangles and has $d_{u, i}$ other\\n    edges. The number $d_{u,t}$ is the *triangle degree* of $u$ and the number\\n    $d_{u,i}$ is the *independent edge degree*.\\n\\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    joint_degree_sequence : list of integer pairs\\n        Each list entry corresponds to the independent edge degree and\\n        triangle degree of a node.\\n    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default MultiGraph)\\n       Graph type to create.

An exception is raised if the\\n    independent degree sequence does not have an even sum or the\\n    triangle degree sequence sum is not divisible by 3.\\n\\n    This configuration model-like construction process can lead to\\n    duplicate edges and loops.  You can remove the self-loops and\\n    parallel edges (see below) which will likely result in a graph\\n    that doesn\\'t have the exact degree sequence specified.  This\\n    \"finite-size effect\" decreases as the size of the graph increases.\\n\\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    .. [1] Joel C.
