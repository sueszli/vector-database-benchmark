Algorithm for testing d-separation in DAGs.

*d-separation* is a test for conditional independence in probability
distributions that can be factorized using DAGs.  It is a purely
graphical test that uses the underlying graph and makes no reference
to the actual distribution parameters.  See [1]_ for a formal
definition.

The implementation is based on the conceptually simple linear time
algorithm presented in [2]_.  Refer to [3]_, [4]_ for a couple of
alternative algorithms.

Here, we provide a brief overview of d-separation and related concepts that
are relevant for understanding it:

Blocking paths
--------------

Before we overview, we introduce the following terminology to describe paths:

- "open" path: A path between two nodes that can be traversed
- "blocked" path: A path between two nodes that cannot be traversed

A **collider** is a triplet of nodes along a path that is like the following:
``... u -> c <- v ...``), where 'c' is a common successor of ``u`` and ``v``. A path
through a collider is considered "blocked". When
a node that is a collider, or a descendant of a collider is included in
the d-separating set, then the path through that collider node is "open". If the
path through the collider node is open, then we will call this node an open collider.

The d-separation set blocks the paths between ``u`` and ``v``. If you include colliders,
or their descendant nodes in the d-separation set, then those colliders will open up,
enabling a path to be traversed if it is not blocked some other way.

Illustration of D-separation with examples
------------------------------------------

For a pair of two nodes, ``u`` and ``v``, all paths are considered open if
there is a path between ``u`` and ``v`` that is not blocked. That means, there is an open
path between ``u`` and ``v`` that does not encounter a collider, or a variable in the
d-separating set.

For example, if the d-separating set is the empty set, then the following paths are
unblocked between ``u`` and ``v``:

- u <- z -> v
- u -> w -> ... -> z -> v

If for example, 'z' is in the d-separating set, then 'z' blocks those paths
between ``u`` and ``v``.

Colliders block a path by default if they and their descendants are not included
in the d-separating set. An example of a path that is blocked when the d-separating
set is empty is:

- u -> w -> ... -> z <- v

because 'z' is a collider in this path and 'z' is not in the d-separating set. However,
if 'z' or a descendant of 'z' is included in the d-separating set, then the path through
the collider at 'z' (... -> z <- ...) is now "open". 

D-separation is concerned with blocking all paths between u and v. Therefore, a
d-separating set between ``u`` and ``v`` is one where all paths are blocked.

D-separation and its applications in probability
------------------------------------------------

D-separation is commonly used in probabilistic graphical models. D-separation
connects the idea of probabilistic "dependence" with separation in a graph. If
one assumes the causal Markov condition [5]_, then d-separation implies conditional
independence in probability distributions.

Examples
--------

>>>
>>> # HMM graph with five states and observation nodes
... g = nx.DiGraph()
>>> g.add_edges_from(
...     [
...         ("S1", "S2"),
...         ("S2", "S3"),
...         ("S3", "S4"),
...         ("S4", "S5"),
...         ("S1", "O1"),
...         ("S2", "O2"),
...         ("S3", "O3"),
...         ("S4", "O4"),
...         ("S5", "O5"),
...     ]
... )
>>>
>>> # states/obs before 'S3' are d-separated from states/obs after 'S3'
... nx.d_separated(g, {"S1", "S2", "O1", "O2"}, {"S4", "S5", "O4", "O5"}, {"S3"})
True
