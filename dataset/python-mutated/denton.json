Ie., the first indicators line up with\\n        the first benchmark.\\n    benchmark : array_like\\n        The higher frequency benchmark.  A 1d or 2d data series in columns.\\n        If 2d, then M series are assumed.\\n    freq : str {\"aq\",\"qm\", \"other\"}\\n        The frequency to use in the conversion.\\n\\n        * \"aq\" - Benchmarking an annual series to quarterly.\\n        * \"mq\" - Benchmarking a quarterly series to monthly.\\n        * \"other\" - Custom stride.
