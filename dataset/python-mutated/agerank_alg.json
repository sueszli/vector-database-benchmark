The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict\\n      value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given\\n      outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not\\n      specified) This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition\\n      matrix (see notes under google_matrix). It may be common to have the\\n      dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.\\n\\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    pagerank : dictionary\\n       Dictionary of nodes with PageRank as value\\n\\n    Examples\\n    --------\\n    >>> from networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg import _pagerank_scipy\\n    >>> G = nx.DiGraph(nx.path_graph(4))\\n    >>> pr = _pagerank_scipy(G, alpha=0.9)\\n\\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    The eigenvector calculation uses power iteration with a SciPy\\n    sparse matrix representation.\\n\\n    This implementation works with Multi(Di)Graphs.
