This is done\\n  in Sampled Softmax and Sampled Logistic.\\n\\n  See our [Candidate Sampling Algorithms\\n  Reference](http://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).\\n\\n  We presuppose that the `sampled_candidates` are unique.\\n\\n  We call it an 'accidental hit' when one of the target classes\\n  matches one of the sampled classes.  This operation reports\\n  accidental hits as triples `(index, id, weight)`, where `index`\\n  represents the row number in `true_classes`, `id` represents the\\n  position in `sampled_candidates`, and weight is `-FLOAT_MAX`.\\n\\n  The result of this op should be passed through a `sparse_to_dense`\\n  operation, then added to the logits of the sampled classes. This\\n  removes the contradictory effect of accidentally sampling the true\\n  target classes as noise classes for the same example.\\n\\n  Args:\\n    true_classes: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,\\n      num_true]`. The target classes.\\n    sampled_candidates: A tensor of type `int64` and shape `[num_sampled]`.\\n      The sampled_candidates output of CandidateSampler.\\n    num_true: An `int`.  The number of target classes per training example.\\n    seed: An `int`. An operation-specific seed. Default is 0.\\n    name: A name for the operation (optional).\\n\\n  Returns:\\n    indices: A `Tensor` of type `int32` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`.\\n      Values indicate rows in `true_classes`.\\n    ids: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`.\\n      Values indicate positions in `sampled_candidates`.\\n    weights: A `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`.\\n      Each value is `-FLOAT_MAX`.\\n\\n  \"\n    (seed1, seed2) = random_seed.get_seed(seed)\n    return gen_candidate_sampling_ops.compute_accidental_hits(true_classes, sampled_candidates, num_true, seed=seed1, seed2=seed2, name=name)"
