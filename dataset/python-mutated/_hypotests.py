A widely used test is\n    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test which relies on the empirical\n    distribution function. Epps and Singleton introduce a test based on the\n    empirical characteristic function in [1]_.\n\n    One advantage of the ES test compared to the KS test is that is does\n    not assume a continuous distribution. In [1]_, the authors conclude\n    that the test also has a higher power than the KS test in many\n    examples. They recommend the use of the ES test for discrete samples as\n    well as continuous samples with at least 25 observations each, whereas\n    `anderson_ksamp` is recommended for smaller sample sizes in the\n    continuous case.\n\n    The p-value is computed from the asymptotic distribution of the test\n    statistic which follows a `chi2` distribution. If the sample size of both\n    `x` and `y` is below 25, the small sample correction proposed in [1]_ is\n    applied to the test statistic.\n\n    The default values of `t` are determined in [1]_ by considering\n    various distributions and finding good values that lead to a high power\n    of the test in general. Table III in [1]_ gives the optimal values for\n    the distributions tested in that study. The values of `t` are scaled by\n    the semi-interquartile range in the implementation, see [1]_.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    .. [1] T. W. Epps and K. J.

Biometrika, 31(3/4), 313-323.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n\n    Suppose that a gardener wishes to test the number of dodder (weed) seeds\n    in a sack of clover seeds that they buy from a seed company. It has\n    previously been established that the number of dodder seeds in clover\n    follows the Poisson distribution.\n\n    A 100 gram sample is drawn from the sack before being shipped to the\n    gardener. The sample is analyzed, and it is found to contain no dodder\n    seeds; that is, `k1` is 0. However, upon arrival, the gardener draws\n    another 100 gram sample from the sack. This time, three dodder seeds are\n    found in the sample; that is, `k2` is 3. The gardener would like to\n    know if the difference is significant and not due to chance. The\n    null hypothesis is that the difference between the two samples is merely\n    due to chance, or that :math:`\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 = \\mathtt{diff}`\n    where :math:`\\mathtt{diff} = 0`. The alternative hypothesis is that the\n    difference is not due to chance, or :math:`\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 \\ne 0`.\n    The gardener selects a significance level of 5% to reject the null\n    hypothesis in favor of the alternative [2]_.\n\n    >>> import scipy.stats as stats\n    >>> res = stats.poisson_means_test(0, 100, 3, 100)\n    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue\n    (-1.7320508075688772, 0.08837900929018157)\n\n    The p-value is .088, indicating a near 9% chance of observing a value of\n    the test statistic under the null hypothesis. This exceeds 5%, so the\n    gardener does not reject the null hypothesis as the difference cannot be\n    regarded as significant at this level.\n    '

We choose a\n    significance level of ``alpha=0.05``.\n\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> from scipy import stats\n    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(165417232101553420507139617764912913465)\n    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500, random_state=rng)\n    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(x, 'norm')\n    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue\n    (0.1072085112565724, 0.5508482238203407)\n\n    The p-value exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not\n    reject the null hypothesis that the observed sample is drawn from the\n    standard normal distribution.\n\n    Now suppose we wish to check whether the same samples shifted by 2.1 is\n    consistent with being drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2.\n\n    >>> y = x + 2.1\n    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, 'norm', args=(2,))\n    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue\n    (0.8364446265294695, 0.00596286797008283)\n\n    Here we have used the `args` keyword to specify the mean (``loc``)\n    of the normal distribution to test the data against. This is equivalent\n    to the following, in which we create a frozen normal distribution with\n    mean 2.1, then pass its ``cdf`` method as an argument.\n\n    >>> frozen_dist = stats.norm(loc=2)\n    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, frozen_dist.cdf)\n    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue\n    (0.8364446265294695, 0.00596286797008283)\n\n    In either case, we would reject the null hypothesis that the observed\n    sample is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 (and default\n    variance of 1) because the p-value is less than our chosen\n    significance level.\n\n    "

    'Calculates Somers\' D, an asymmetric measure of ordinal association.\n\n    Like Kendall\'s :math:`\\tau`, Somers\' :math:`D` is a measure of the\n    correspondence between two rankings. Both statistics consider the\n    difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs in two\n    rankings :math:`X` and :math:`Y`, and both are normalized such that values\n    close  to 1 indicate strong agreement and values close to -1 indicate\n    strong disagreement. They differ in how they are normalized. To show the\n    relationship, Somers\' :math:`D` can be defined in terms of Kendall\'s\n    :math:`\\tau_a`:\n\n    .. math::\n        D(Y|X) = \\frac{\\tau_a(X, Y)}{\\tau_a(X, X)}\n\n    Suppose the first ranking :math:`X` has :math:`r` distinct ranks and the\n    second ranking :math:`Y` has :math:`s` distinct ranks. These two lists of\n    :math:`n` rankings can also be viewed as an :math:`r \\times s` contingency\n    table in which element :math:`i, j` is the number of rank pairs with rank\n    :math:`i` in ranking :math:`X` and rank :math:`j` in ranking :math:`Y`.\n    Accordingly, `somersd` also allows the input data to be supplied as a\n    single, 2D contingency table instead of as two separate, 1D rankings.\n\n    Note that the definition of Somers\' :math:`D` is asymmetric: in general,\n    :math:`D(Y|X) \\neq D(X|Y)`. ``somersd(x, y)`` calculates Somers\'\n    :math:`D(Y|X)`: the "row" variable :math:`X` is treated as an independent\n    variable, and the "column" variable :math:`Y` is dependent.

If the null\n    hypothesis of independence is desired, it is acceptable to use the\n    *p*-value returned by `kendalltau` with the statistic returned by\n    `somersd` and vice versa. For more information, see [2]_.\n\n    Contingency tables are formatted according to the convention used by\n    SAS and R: the first ranking supplied (``x``) is the "row" variable, and\n    the second ranking supplied (``y``) is the "column" variable.

The independent variable, hotel\n    room cleanliness, is ranked on an ordinal scale: "below average (1)",\n    "average (2)", or "above average (3)". The dependent variable, customer\n    satisfaction, is ranked on a second scale: "very dissatisfied (1)",\n    "moderately dissatisfied (2)", "neither dissatisfied nor satisfied (3)",\n    "moderately satisfied (4)", or "very satisfied (5)". 189 customers\n    respond to the survey, and the results are cast into a contingency table\n    with the hotel room cleanliness as the "row" variable and customer\n    satisfaction as the "column" variable.\n\n    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n    |     | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |\n    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+\n    | (1) | 27  | 25  | 14  | 7   | 0   |\n    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n    | (2) | 7   | 14  | 18  | 35  | 12  |\n    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n    | (3) | 1   | 3   | 2   | 7   | 17  |\n    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\n    For example, 27 customers assigned their room a cleanliness ranking of\n    "below average (1)" and a corresponding satisfaction of "very\n    dissatisfied (1)". We perform the analysis as follows.\n\n    >>> from scipy.stats import somersd\n    >>> table = [[27, 25, 14, 7, 0], [7, 14, 18, 35, 12], [1, 3, 2, 7, 17]]\n    >>> res = somersd(table)\n    >>> res.statistic\n    0.6032766111513396\n    >>> res.pvalue\n    1.0007091191074533e-27\n\n    The value of the Somers\' D statistic is approximately 0.6, indicating\n    a positive correlation between room cleanliness and customer satisfaction\n    in the sample.\n    The *p*-value is very small, indicating a very small probability of\n    observing such an extreme value of the statistic under the null\n    hypothesis that the statistic of the entire population (from which\n    our sample of 189 customers is drawn) is zero. This supports the\n    alternative hypothesis that the true value of Somers\' D for the population\n    is nonzero.\n\n    '

[3] "Wald Test". *Wikipedia*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    An example use of Barnard\'s test is presented in [2]_.\n\n        Consider the following example of a vaccine efficacy study\n        (Chan, 1998). In a randomized clinical trial of 30 subjects, 15 were\n        inoculated with a recombinant DNA influenza vaccine and the 15 were\n        inoculated with a placebo. Twelve of the 15 subjects in the placebo\n        group (80%) eventually became infected with influenza whereas for the\n        vaccine group, only 7 of the 15 subjects (47%) became infected. The\n        data are tabulated as a 2 x 2 table::\n\n                Vaccine  Placebo\n            Yes     7        12\n            No      8        3\n\n    When working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a\n    threshold probability or significance level upon which we decide\n    to reject the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`. Suppose we choose the common\n    significance level of 5%.\n\n    Our alternative hypothesis is that the vaccine will lower the chance of\n    becoming infected with the virus; that is, the probability :math:`p_1` of\n    catching the virus with the vaccine will be *less than* the probability\n    :math:`p_2` of catching the virus without the vaccine.  Therefore, we call\n    `barnard_exact` with the ``alternative="less"`` option:\n\n    >>> import scipy.stats as stats\n    >>> res = stats.barnard_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")\n    >>> res.statistic\n    -1.894...\n    >>> res.pvalue\n    0.03407...\n\n    Under the null hypothesis that the vaccine will not lower the chance of\n    becoming infected, the probability of obtaining test results at least as\n    extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.4%. Since this p-value is\n    less than our chosen significance level, we have evidence to reject\n    :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative.\n\n    Suppose we had used Fisher\'s exact test instead:\n\n    >>> _, pvalue = stats.fisher_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")\n    >>> pvalue\n    0.0640...\n\n    With the same threshold significance of 5%, we would not have been able\n    to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. As stated in\n    [2]_, Barnard\'s test is uniformly more powerful than Fisher\'s exact test\n    because Barnard\'s test does not condition on any margin. Fisher\'s test\n    should only be used when both sets of marginals are fixed.\n\n    '

It examines the association of two categorical variables, and\n    is a uniformly more powerful alternative to Fisher\'s exact test\n    for 2x2 contingency tables.\n\n    Boschloo\'s exact test uses the p-value of Fisher\'s exact test as a\n    statistic, and Boschloo\'s p-value is the probability under the null\n    hypothesis of observing such an extreme value of this statistic.\n\n    Let\'s define :math:`X_0` a 2x2 matrix representing the observed sample,\n    where each column stores the binomial experiment, as in the example\n    below. Let\'s also define :math:`p_1, p_2` the theoretical binomial\n    probabilities for  :math:`x_{11}` and :math:`x_{12}`. When using\n    Boschloo exact test, we can assert three different alternative hypotheses:\n\n    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 < p_2`,\n      with `alternative` = "less"\n\n    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 > p_2`,\n      with `alternative` = "greater"\n\n    - :math:`H_0 : p_1=p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 \\neq p_2`,\n      with `alternative` = "two-sided" (default)\n\n    There are multiple conventions for computing a two-sided p-value when the\n    null distribution is asymmetric. Here, we apply the convention that the\n    p-value of a two-sided test is twice the minimum of the p-values of the\n    one-sided tests (clipped to 1.0). Note that `fisher_exact` follows a\n    different convention, so for a given `table`, the statistic reported by\n    `boschloo_exact` may differ from the p-value reported by `fisher_exact`\n    when ``alternative=\'two-sided\'``.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..

Therefore, we expect\n    :math:`p_1` the proportion of very satisfied college professors to be\n    greater than :math:`p_2`, the proportion of very satisfied scientists.\n    We thus call `boschloo_exact` with the ``alternative="greater"`` option:\n\n    >>> import scipy.stats as stats\n    >>> res = stats.boschloo_exact([[74, 31], [43, 32]], alternative="greater")\n    >>> res.statistic\n    0.0483...\n    >>> res.pvalue\n    0.0355...\n\n    Under the null hypothesis that scientists are happier in their work than\n    college professors, the probability of obtaining test\n    results at least as extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.55%.\n    Since this p-value is less than our chosen significance level, we have\n    evidence to reject :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n    '

Whereas ANOVA (e.g. `f_oneway`)\n    assesses whether the true means underlying each sample are identical,\n    Tukey\'s HSD is a post hoc test used to compare the mean of each sample\n    to the mean of each other sample.\n\n    The null hypothesis is that the distributions underlying the samples all\n    have the same mean. The test statistic, which is computed for every\n    possible pairing of samples, is simply the difference between the sample\n    means. For each pair, the p-value is the probability under the null\n    hypothesis (and other assumptions; see notes) of observing such an extreme\n    value of the statistic, considering that many pairwise comparisons are\n    being performed.
