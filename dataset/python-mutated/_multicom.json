Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Test\n    is another multiple-comparison test that controls the family-wise error\n    rate, but `tukey_hsd` performs *all* pairwise comparisons between groups.\n    When pairwise comparisons between experimental groups are not needed,\n    Dunnett's test is preferable due to its higher power.\n\n\n    The use of this test relies on several assumptions.\n\n    1. The observations are independent within and among groups.\n    2. The observations within each group are normally distributed.\n    3.

First, visually examine a box and whisker plot.\n\n    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\n    >>> ax.boxplot([control, drug_a, drug_b])\n    >>> ax.set_xticklabels([\"Control\", \"Drug A\", \"Drug B\"])  # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> ax.set_ylabel(\"mean\")  # doctest: +SKIP\n    >>> plt.show()\n\n    Note the overlapping interquartile ranges of the drug A group and control\n    group and the apparent separation between the drug B group and control\n    group.\n\n    Next, we will use Dunnett's test to assess whether the difference\n    between group means is significant while controlling the family-wise error\n    rate: the probability of making any false discoveries.\n    Let the null hypothesis be that the experimental groups have the same\n    mean as the control and the alternative be that an experimental group does\n    not have the same mean as the control. We will consider a 5% family-wise\n    error rate to be acceptable, and therefore we choose 0.05 as the threshold\n    for significance.\n\n    >>> from scipy.stats import dunnett\n    >>> res = dunnett(drug_a, drug_b, control=control)\n    >>> res.pvalue\n    array([0.62004941, 0.0059035 ])  # may vary\n\n    The p-value corresponding with the comparison between group A and control\n    exceeds 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis for that comparison.\n    However, the p-value corresponding with the comparison between group B\n    and control is less than 0.05, so we consider the experimental results\n    to be evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative:\n    group B has a different mean than the control group.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    (samples_, control_, rng) = _iv_dunnett(samples=samples, control=control, alternative=alternative, random_state=random_state)\n    (rho, df, n_group, n_samples, n_control) = _params_dunnett(samples=samples_, control=control_)\n    (statistic, std, mean_control, mean_samples) = _statistic_dunnett(samples_, control_, df, n_samples, n_control)\n    pvalue = _pvalue_dunnett(rho=rho, df=df, statistic=statistic, alternative=alternative, rng=rng)\n    return DunnettResult(statistic=statistic, pvalue=pvalue, _alternative=alternative, _rho=rho, _df=df, _std=std, _mean_samples=mean_samples, _mean_control=mean_control, _n_samples=n_samples, _n_control=n_control, _rng=rng)",
