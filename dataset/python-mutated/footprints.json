A disk footprint can be\\n    approximated by applying a series of smaller footprints of extent 3 along\\n    each axis. Specific solutions for this are given in [1]_ for the case of\\n    2D disks with radius 2 through 10. Here, we numerically computed the number\\n    of repetitions of each element that gives the closest match to the disk\\n    computed with kwargs ``strict_radius=False, decomposition=None``.\\n\\n    Empirically, the series decomposition at large radius approaches a\\n    hexadecagon (a 16-sided polygon [2]_). In [3]_, the authors demonstrate\\n    that a hexadecagon is the closest approximation to a disk that can be\\n    achieved for decomposition with footprints of shape (3, 3).\\n\\n    The disk produced by the ``decomposition='crosses'`` is often but not\\n    always  identical to that with ``decomposition=None``. It tends to give a\\n    closer approximation than ``decomposition='sequence'``, at a performance\\n    that is fairly comparable. The individual cross-shaped elements are not\\n    limited to extent (3, 3) in size. Unlike the 'seqeuence' decomposition, the\\n    'crosses' decomposition can also accurately approximate the shape of disks\\n    with ``strict_radius=True``. The method is based on an adaption of\\n    algorithm 1 given in [4]_.\\n\\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    .. [1] Park, H and Chin R.T.
