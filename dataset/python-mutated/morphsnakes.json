This is very rarely the\\n        original image. Instead, this is usually a preprocessed version of the\\n        original image that enhances and highlights the borders (or other\\n        structures) of the object to segment.\\n        :func:`morphological_geodesic_active_contour` will try to stop the contour\\n        evolution in areas where `gimage` is small. See\\n        :func:`inverse_gaussian_gradient` as an example function to\\n        perform this preprocessing. Note that the quality of\\n        :func:`morphological_geodesic_active_contour` might greatly depend on this\\n        preprocessing.\\n    num_iter : uint\\n        Number of num_iter to run.\\n    init_level_set : str, (M, N) array, or (L, M, N) array\\n        Initial level set. If an array is given, it will be binarized and used\\n        as the initial level set. If a string is given, it defines the method\\n        to generate a reasonable initial level set with the shape of the\\n        `image`. Accepted values are 'checkerboard' and 'disk'. See the\\n        documentation of `checkerboard_level_set` and `disk_level_set`\\n        respectively for details about how these level sets are created.\\n    smoothing : uint, optional\\n        Number of times the smoothing operator is applied per iteration.\\n        Reasonable values are around 1-4. Larger values lead to smoother\\n        segmentations.\\n    threshold : float, optional\\n        Areas of the image with a value smaller than this threshold will be\\n        considered borders. The evolution of the contour will stop in these\\n        areas.\\n    balloon : float, optional\\n        Balloon force to guide the contour in non-informative areas of the\\n        image, i.e., areas where the gradient of the image is too small to push\\n        the contour towards a border. A negative value will shrink the contour,\\n        while a positive value will expand the contour in these areas. Setting\\n        this to zero will disable the balloon force.\\n    iter_callback : function, optional\\n        If given, this function is called once per iteration with the current\\n        level set as the only argument. This is useful for debugging or for\\n        plotting intermediate results during the evolution.\\n\\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    out : (M, N) or (L, M, N) array\\n        Final segmentation (i.e., the final level set)\\n\\n    See Also\\n    --------\\n    inverse_gaussian_gradient, disk_level_set, checkerboard_level_set\\n\\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    This is a version of the Geodesic Active Contours (GAC) algorithm that uses\\n    morphological operators instead of solving partial differential equations\\n    (PDEs) for the evolution of the contour.
