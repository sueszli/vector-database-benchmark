For flat peaks\n    (more than one sample of equal amplitude wide) the index of the middle\n    sample is returned (rounded down in case the number of samples is even).\n    For noisy signals the peak locations can be off because the noise might\n    change the position of local maxima.

The open interval ``(None, None)`` can be specified\n      as well, which returns the matching properties without exclusion of peaks.\n    * The border is always included in the interval used to select valid peaks.\n    * For several conditions the interval borders can be specified with\n      arrays matching `x` in shape which enables dynamic constrains based on\n      the sample position.\n    * The conditions are evaluated in the following order: `plateau_size`,\n      `height`, `threshold`, `distance`, `prominence`, `width`. In most cases\n      this order is the fastest one because faster operations are applied first\n      to reduce the number of peaks that need to be evaluated later.\n    * While indices in `peaks` are guaranteed to be at least `distance` samples\n      apart, edges of flat peaks may be closer than the allowed `distance`.\n    * Use `wlen` to reduce the time it takes to evaluate the conditions for\n      `prominence` or `width` if `x` is large or has many local maxima\n      (see `peak_prominences`).\n    \"\"\"\n    x = _arg_x_as_expected(x)\n    if distance is not None and distance < 1:\n        raise ValueError('`distance` must be greater or equal to 1')\n    (peaks, left_edges, right_edges) = _local_maxima_1d(x)\n    properties = {}\n    if plateau_size is not None:\n        plateau_sizes = right_edges - left_edges + 1\n        (pmin, pmax) = _unpack_condition_args(plateau_size, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(plateau_sizes, pmin, pmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['plateau_sizes'] = plateau_sizes\n        properties['left_edges'] = left_edges\n        properties['right_edges'] = right_edges\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if height is not None:\n        peak_heights = x[peaks]\n        (hmin, hmax) = _unpack_condition_args(height, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(peak_heights, hmin, hmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['peak_heights'] = peak_heights\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if threshold is not None:\n        (tmin, tmax) = _unpack_condition_args(threshold, x, peaks)\n        (keep, left_thresholds, right_thresholds) = _select_by_peak_threshold(x, peaks, tmin, tmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['left_thresholds'] = left_thresholds\n        properties['right_thresholds'] = right_thresholds\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if distance is not None:\n        keep = _select_by_peak_distance(peaks, x[peaks], distance)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if prominence is not None or width is not None:\n        wlen = _arg_wlen_as_expected(wlen)\n        properties.update(zip(['prominences', 'left_bases', 'right_bases'], _peak_prominences(x, peaks, wlen=wlen)))\n    if prominence is not None:\n        (pmin, pmax) = _unpack_condition_args(prominence, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(properties['prominences'], pmin, pmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if width is not None:\n        properties.update(zip(['widths', 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips'], _peak_widths(x, peaks, rel_height, properties['prominences'], properties['left_bases'], properties['right_bases'])))\n        (wmin, wmax) = _unpack_condition_args(width, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(properties['widths'], wmin, wmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    return (peaks, properties)",

To\\n    avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.\\n\\n    See Also\\n    --------\\n    find_peaks_cwt\\n        Find peaks using the wavelet transformation.\\n    peak_prominences\\n        Directly calculate the prominence of peaks.\\n    peak_widths\\n        Directly calculate the width of peaks.\\n\\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    In the context of this function, a peak or local maximum is defined as any\\n    sample whose two direct neighbours have a smaller amplitude. For flat peaks\\n    (more than one sample of equal amplitude wide) the index of the middle\\n    sample is returned (rounded down in case the number of samples is even).\\n    For noisy signals the peak locations can be off because the noise might\\n    change the position of local maxima. In those cases consider smoothing the\\n    signal before searching for peaks or use other peak finding and fitting\\n    methods (like `find_peaks_cwt`).\\n\\n    Some additional comments on specifying conditions:\\n\\n    * Almost all conditions (excluding `distance`) can be given as half-open or\\n      closed intervals, e.g., ``1`` or ``(1, None)`` defines the half-open\\n      interval :math:`[1, \\\\infty]` while ``(None, 1)`` defines the interval\\n      :math:`[-\\\\infty, 1]`. The open interval ``(None, None)`` can be specified\\n      as well, which returns the matching properties without exclusion of peaks.\\n    * The border is always included in the interval used to select valid peaks.\\n    * For several conditions the interval borders can be specified with\\n      arrays matching `x` in shape which enables dynamic constrains based on\\n      the sample position.\\n    * The conditions are evaluated in the following order: `plateau_size`,\\n      `height`, `threshold`, `distance`, `prominence`, `width`. In most cases\\n      this order is the fastest one because faster operations are applied first\\n      to reduce the number of peaks that need to be evaluated later.\\n    * While indices in `peaks` are guaranteed to be at least `distance` samples\\n      apart, edges of flat peaks may be closer than the allowed `distance`.\\n    * Use `wlen` to reduce the time it takes to evaluate the conditions for\\n      `prominence` or `width` if `x` is large or has many local maxima\\n      (see `peak_prominences`).\\n    \"\n    x = _arg_x_as_expected(x)\n    if distance is not None and distance < 1:\n        raise ValueError('`distance` must be greater or equal to 1')\n    (peaks, left_edges, right_edges) = _local_maxima_1d(x)\n    properties = {}\n    if plateau_size is not None:\n        plateau_sizes = right_edges - left_edges + 1\n        (pmin, pmax) = _unpack_condition_args(plateau_size, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(plateau_sizes, pmin, pmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['plateau_sizes'] = plateau_sizes\n        properties['left_edges'] = left_edges\n        properties['right_edges'] = right_edges\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if height is not None:\n        peak_heights = x[peaks]\n        (hmin, hmax) = _unpack_condition_args(height, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(peak_heights, hmin, hmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['peak_heights'] = peak_heights\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if threshold is not None:\n        (tmin, tmax) = _unpack_condition_args(threshold, x, peaks)\n        (keep, left_thresholds, right_thresholds) = _select_by_peak_threshold(x, peaks, tmin, tmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties['left_thresholds'] = left_thresholds\n        properties['right_thresholds'] = right_thresholds\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if distance is not None:\n        keep = _select_by_peak_distance(peaks, x[peaks], distance)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if prominence is not None or width is not None:\n        wlen = _arg_wlen_as_expected(wlen)\n        properties.update(zip(['prominences', 'left_bases', 'right_bases'], _peak_prominences(x, peaks, wlen=wlen)))\n    if prominence is not None:\n        (pmin, pmax) = _unpack_condition_args(prominence, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(properties['prominences'], pmin, pmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    if width is not None:\n        properties.update(zip(['widths', 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips'], _peak_widths(x, peaks, rel_height, properties['prominences'], properties['left_bases'], properties['right_bases'])))\n        (wmin, wmax) = _unpack_condition_args(width, x, peaks)\n        keep = _select_by_property(properties['widths'], wmin, wmax)\n        peaks = peaks[keep]\n        properties = {key: array[keep] for (key, array) in properties.items()}\n    return (peaks, properties)"
