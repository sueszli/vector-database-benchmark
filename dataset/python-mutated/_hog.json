The compression makes\n    the dark regions lighter. When the kwarg `transform_sqrt` is set to\n    ``True``, the function computes the square root of each color channel\n    and then applies the hog algorithm to the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    image = np.atleast_2d(image)\n    float_dtype = utils._supported_float_type(image.dtype)\n    image = image.astype(float_dtype, copy=False)\n    multichannel = channel_axis is not None\n    ndim_spatial = image.ndim - 1 if multichannel else image.ndim\n    if ndim_spatial != 2:\n        raise ValueError('Only images with two spatial dimensions are supported. If using with color/multichannel images, specify `channel_axis`.')\n    '\\n    The first stage applies an optional global image normalization\\n    equalisation that is designed to reduce the influence of illumination\\n    effects. In practice we use gamma (power law) compression, either\\n    computing the square root or the log of each color channel.\\n    Image texture strength is typically proportional to the local surface\\n    illumination so this compression helps to reduce the effects of local\\n    shadowing and illumination variations.\\n    '\n    if transform_sqrt:\n        image = np.sqrt(image)\n    '\\n    The second stage computes first order image gradients. These capture\\n    contour, silhouette and some texture information, while providing\\n    further resistance to illumination variations. The locally dominant\\n    color channel is used, which provides color invariance to a large\\n    extent.

The adopted method pools gradient orientation\\n    information locally in the same way as the SIFT [Lowe 2004]\\n    feature. The image window is divided into small spatial regions,\\n    called \"cells\". For each cell we accumulate a local 1-D histogram\\n    of gradient or edge orientations over all the pixels in the\\n    cell.
