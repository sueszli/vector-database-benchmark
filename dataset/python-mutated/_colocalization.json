You may wish to plot the pixel intensities of each of the two\\n    channels in a 2D scatterplot and use Spearman's rank correlation if a\\n    non-linear correlation is visually identified [2]_. Also consider if you\\n    are interested in correlation or co-occurence, in which case a method\\n    involving segmentation masks (e.g. MCC or intersection coefficient) may be\\n    more suitable [3]_ [4]_.\\n\\n    Providing the mask of only relevant sections of the image (e.g., cells, or\\n    particular cellular compartments) and removing noise is important as the\\n    PCC is sensitive to these measures [3]_ [4]_.\\n\\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..
