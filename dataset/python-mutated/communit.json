This is accomplished by either\\n\\n       a) specifying ``min_degree`` and not ``average_degree``,\\n       b) specifying ``average_degree`` and not ``min_degree``, in which\\n          case a suitable minimum degree will be found.\\n\\n       ``max_degree`` can also be specified, otherwise it will be set to\\n       ``n``. Each node *u* will have $\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{deg}(u)$ edges\\n       joining it to nodes in communities other than its own and $(1 -\\n       \\\\mu) \\\\mathrm{deg}(u)$ edges joining it to nodes in its own\\n       community.\\n    2) Generate community sizes according to a power law distribution\\n       with exponent ``tau2``. If ``min_community`` and\\n       ``max_community`` are not specified they will be selected to be\\n       ``min_degree`` and ``max_degree``, respectively.
