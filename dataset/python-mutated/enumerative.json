Uses dynamic\\n        programming to cut down on the number of nodes actually\\n        explored.  The dictionary used in order to accelerate the\\n        counting process is stored in the ``MultisetPartitionTraverser``\\n        object and persists across calls.  If the user does not\\n        expect to call ``count_partitions`` for any additional\\n        multisets, the object should be cleared to save memory.  On\\n        the other hand, the cache built up from one count run can\\n        significantly speed up subsequent calls to ``count_partitions``,\\n        so it may be advantageous not to clear the object.\\n\\n        Examples\\n        ========\\n\\n        >>> from sympy.utilities.enumerative import MultisetPartitionTraverser\\n        >>> m = MultisetPartitionTraverser()\\n        >>> m.count_partitions([9,8,2])\\n        288716\\n        >>> m.count_partitions([2,2])\\n        9\\n        >>> del m\\n\\n        Notes\\n        =====\\n\\n        If one looks at the workings of Knuth's algorithm M [AOCP]_, it\\n        can be viewed as a traversal of a binary tree of parts.  A\\n        part has (up to) two children, the left child resulting from\\n        the spread operation, and the right child from the decrement\\n        operation.  The ordinary enumeration of multiset partitions is\\n        an in-order traversal of this tree, and with the partitions\\n        corresponding to paths from the root to the leaves. The\\n        mapping from paths to partitions is a little complicated,\\n        since the partition would contain only those parts which are\\n        leaves or the parents of a spread link, not those which are\\n        parents of a decrement link.\\n\\n        For counting purposes, it is sufficient to count leaves, and\\n        this can be done with a recursive in-order traversal.  The\\n        number of leaves of a subtree rooted at a particular part is a\\n        function only of that part itself, so memoizing has the\\n        potential to speed up the counting dramatically.\\n\\n        This method follows a computational approach which is similar\\n        to the hypothetical memoized recursive function, but with two\\n        differences:\\n\\n        1) This method is iterative, borrowing its structure from the\\n           other enumerations and maintaining an explicit stack of\\n           parts which are in the process of being counted.  (There\\n           may be multisets which can be counted reasonably quickly by\\n           this implementation, but which would overflow the default\\n           Python recursion limit with a recursive implementation.)\\n\\n        2) Instead of using the part data structure directly, a more\\n           compact key is constructed.
