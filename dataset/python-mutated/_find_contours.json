A simple explanation is available here:\n\n    http://users.polytech.unice.fr/~lingrand/MarchingCubes/algo.html\n\n    There is a single ambiguous case in the marching squares algorithm: when\n    a given ``2 x 2``-element square has two high-valued and two low-valued\n    elements, each pair diagonally adjacent. (Where high- and low-valued is\n    with respect to the contour value sought.) In this case, either the\n    high-valued elements can be 'connected together' via a thin isthmus that\n    separates the low-valued elements, or vice-versa. When elements are\n    connected together across a diagonal, they are considered 'fully\n    connected' (also known as 'face+vertex-connected' or '8-connected'). Only\n    high-valued or low-valued elements can be fully-connected, the other set\n    will be considered as 'face-connected' or '4-connected'. By default,\n    low-valued elements are considered fully-connected; this can be altered\n    with the 'fully_connected' parameter.\n\n    Output contours are not guaranteed to be closed: contours which intersect\n    the array edge or a masked-off region (either where mask is False or where\n    array is NaN) will be left open. All other contours will be closed. (The\n    closed-ness of a contours can be tested by checking whether the beginning\n    point is the same as the end point.)\n\n    Contours are oriented. By default, array values lower than the contour\n    value are to the left of the contour and values greater than the contour\n    value are to the right. This means that contours will wind\n    counter-clockwise (i.e. in 'positive orientation') around islands of\n    low-valued pixels. This behavior can be altered with the\n    'positive_orientation' parameter.\n\n    The order of the contours in the output list is determined by the position\n    of the smallest ``x,y`` (in lexicographical order) coordinate in the\n    contour.  This is a side-effect of how the input array is traversed, but\n    can be relied upon.\n\n    .. warning::\n\n       Array coordinates/values are assumed to refer to the *center* of the\n       array element. Take a simple example input: ``[0, 1]``. The interpolated\n       position of 0.5 in this array is midway between the 0-element (at\n       ``x=0``) and the 1-element (at ``x=1``), and thus would fall at\n       ``x=0.5``.\n\n    This means that to find reasonable contours, it is best to find contours\n    midway between the expected \"light\" and \"dark\" values. In particular,\n    given a binarized array, *do not* choose to find contours at the low or\n    high value of the array. This will often yield degenerate contours,\n    especially around structures that are a single array element wide.
