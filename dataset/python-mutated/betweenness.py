For an estimate\n    of the number of pivots needed see [3]_.\n\n    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.\n    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length\n    paths between pairs of nodes.\n\n    The total number of paths between source and target is counted\n    differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths\n    are easy to count. Undirected paths are tricky: should a path\n    from "u" to "v" count as 1 undirected path or as 2 directed paths?\n\n    For betweenness_centrality we report the number of undirected\n    paths when G is undirected.\n\n    For betweenness_centrality_subset the reporting is different.\n    If the source and target subsets are the same, then we want\n    to count undirected paths. But if the source and target subsets\n    differ -- for example, if sources is {0} and targets is {1},\n    then we are only counting the paths in one direction. They are\n    undirected paths but we are counting them in a directed way.\n    To count them as undirected paths, each should count as half a path.\n\n    This algorithm is not guaranteed to be correct if edge weights\n    are floating point numbers. As a workaround you can use integer\n    numbers by multiplying the relevant edge attributes by a convenient\n    constant factor (eg 100) and converting to integers.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
