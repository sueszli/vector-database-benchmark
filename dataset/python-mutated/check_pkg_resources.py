"""
This test case verifies that pkg_resources imports from ansible plugins are functional.

If pkg_resources is not installed this test will succeed.
If pkg_resources is installed but is unable to function, this test will fail.

One known failure case this test can detect is when ansible declares a __requires__ and then tests are run without an egg-info directory.
