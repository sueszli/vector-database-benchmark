TEXT = '\nHugging Face was founded in 2016 by French entrepreneurs Cl√©ment Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf originally as a company that developed a chatbot app targeted at teenagers.[2] After open-sourcing the model behind the chatbot, the company pivoted to focus on being a platform for machine learning.\n\nIn March 2021, Hugging Face raised $40 million in a Series B funding round.[3]\n\nOn April 28, 2021, the company launched the BigScience Research Workshop in collaboration with several other research groups to release an open large language model.[4] In 2022, the workshop concluded with the announcement of BLOOM, a multilingual large language model with 176 billion parameters.[5]\n'
