The signature of callbacks should look like:\n\n            .. code-block::\n\n                def callback(tensor: Tensor, grad: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n                    ...\n                    # returned grad is passed to subsequent callbacks\n                    # and finally accumulated to the .grad attribute of tensor\n                    return grad\n\n        :meth:`attach` calls with overlapping tensors will result in their callbacks concatenated,\n        independently for each tensor. For example,\n\n            .. code-block::\n\n                gm.attach([x, y], callbacks=[f])\n                gm.attach([y], callbacks=[g])\n\n        is equivalent to\n\n            .. code-block::\n\n                gm.attach([x], callbacks=[f])\n                gm.attach([y], callbacks=[f, g])\n\n        The effect of :meth:`attach` will persist across multiple uses of the GradManager. When\n        reusing a GradManager, it is likely a mistake to call :meth:`attach` on the same set of\n        tensors and callbacks repeatedly, which may grow the callback list indefinitely.\n\n        .. note::\n\n            When reusing a GradManager, it is sometimes desirable to attach temporary tensors each\n            time, e.g. for computing gradients of inputs of a neural network. GradManager tries to\n            accommodate such usages by holding weak references to attached tensors. Most of the\n            times, this should be enough to prevent resource leak. Unfortunately, there are still\n            some pitfalls left:\n\n                - Callbacks should not hold strong references, directly or indirectly, to attached\n                  tensors. Any strong reference, including those from callbacks, will prevent\n                  garbage collection (even by the cycle collector!) of a attached tensor, until\n                  the GradManager object is garbage collected.\n\n            Please also note that GradManager might hold additional strong references to attached\n            tensors when it is in use.

GradManager tries to\\n            accommodate such usages by holding weak references to attached tensors. Most of the\\n            times, this should be enough to prevent resource leak. Unfortunately, there are still\\n            some pitfalls left:\\n\\n                - Callbacks should not hold strong references, directly or indirectly, to attached\\n                  tensors. Any strong reference, including those from callbacks, will prevent\\n                  garbage collection (even by the cycle collector!) of a attached tensor, until\\n                  the GradManager object is garbage collected.\\n\\n            Please also note that GradManager might hold additional strong references to attached\\n            tensors when it is in use. This note only covers potential resource leaks across\\n            multiple uses of a GradManager, which is unrelated to whether resources is timely\\n            released within a single use.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            tensors: tensor or list of tensors to track\\n            callbacks: callback or list of callbacks\\n        '\n    if callbacks is None:\n        callbacks = []\n    if isinstance(callbacks, Callable):\n        callbacks = [callbacks]\n    if isinstance(tensors, Tensor):\n        tensors = [tensors]\n\n    def make_spec(tensor):\n        selfref = weakref.ref(self)\n        key = id(tensor)\n\n        def deleter(_):\n            self = selfref()\n            if self is not None:\n                del self._attach_specs[key]\n        spec = AttachSpec()\n        spec.tensor = weakref.ref(tensor, deleter)\n        spec.callbacks = []\n        return spec\n    for x in tensors:\n        assert isinstance(x, Tensor), 'Object to be attached should be Tensor'\n        assert is_differentible_dtype(x.dtype), 'Only tensors of floating point dtype can be attached to get gradients, get tensor dtype: {} and shape: {}'.format(x.dtype, x.shape)\n        spec = self._attach_specs.get(id(x))\n        new_attach = spec is None\n        if spec is None:\n            spec = make_spec(x)\n            self._attach_specs[id(x)] = spec\n        spec.callbacks.extend(callbacks)\n        if new_attach and self._recording:\n            self._do_record(spec)\n    return self"
