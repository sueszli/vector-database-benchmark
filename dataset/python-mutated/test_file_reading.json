The second argument is another string\n    containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be:\n\n    - 'r' when the file will only be read,\n    - 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),\n    - 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to end.\n    - 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.\n\n    The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if it\u2019s omitted.\n\n    Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the\n    file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is\n    platform dependent (see open()). 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode: now\n    the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all\n    files that don\u2019t contain text.\n\n    In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (\n on\n    Unix, \\r\n on Windows) to just \n.
