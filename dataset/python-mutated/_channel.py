    "Open a channel for passing objects between tasks within a process.\n\n    Memory channels are lightweight, cheap to allocate, and entirely\n    in-memory. They don't involve any operating-system resources, or any kind\n    of serialization. They just pass Python objects directly between tasks\n    (with a possible stop in an internal buffer along the way).\n\n    Channel objects can be closed by calling `~trio.abc.AsyncResource.aclose`\n    or using ``async with``. They are *not* automatically closed when garbage\n    collected. Closing memory channels isn't mandatory, but it is generally a\n    good idea, because it helps avoid situations where tasks get stuck waiting\n    on a channel when there's no-one on the other side. See\n    :ref:`channel-shutdown` for details.\n\n    Memory channel operations are all atomic with respect to\n    cancellation, either `~trio.abc.ReceiveChannel.receive` will\n    successfully return an object, or it will raise :exc:`Cancelled`\n    while leaving the channel unchanged.\n\n    Args:\n      max_buffer_size (int or math.inf): The maximum number of items that can\n        be buffered in the channel before :meth:`~trio.abc.SendChannel.send`\n        blocks. Choosing a sensible value here is important to ensure that\n        backpressure is communicated promptly and avoid unnecessary latency;\n        see :ref:`channel-buffering` for more details. If in doubt, use 0.\n\n    Returns:\n      A pair ``(send_channel, receive_channel)``. If you have\n      trouble remembering which order these go in, remember: data\n      flows from left â†’ right.\n\n    In addition to the standard channel methods, all memory channel objects\n    provide a ``statistics()`` method, which returns an object with the\n    following fields:\n\n    * ``current_buffer_used``: The number of items currently stored in the\n      channel buffer.\n    * ``max_buffer_size``: The maximum number of items allowed in the buffer,\n      as passed to :func:`open_memory_channel`.\n    * ``open_send_channels``: The number of open\n      :class:`MemorySendChannel` endpoints pointing to this channel.\n      Initially 1, but can be increased by\n      :meth:`MemorySendChannel.clone`.\n    * ``open_receive_channels``: Likewise, but for open\n      :class:`MemoryReceiveChannel` endpoints.\n    * ``tasks_waiting_send``: The number of tasks blocked in ``send`` on this\n      channel (summing over all clones).\n    * ``tasks_waiting_receive``: The number of tasks blocked in ``receive`` on\n      this channel (summing over all clones).\n\n    "
