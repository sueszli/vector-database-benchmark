This method acts as a\\n        utility to produce the correctly-structred pairs of points and vectors\\n        required so that these can be easily concatenated with other items in\\n        the list of loads and passed to ``KanesMethod.kanes_equations``. These\\n        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other\\n        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.\\n\\n        Examples\\n        ========\\n\\n        The below example shows how to generate the loads produced in an\\n        actuator that follows an obstacle-set pathway between four points and\\n        produces an expansile force ``F``. First, create a pair of reference\\n        frames, ``A`` and ``B``, in which the four points ``pA``, ``pB``,\\n        ``pC``, and ``pD`` will be located. The first two points in frame ``A``\\n        and the second two in frame ``B``. Frame ``B`` will also be oriented\\n        such that it relates to ``A`` via a rotation of ``q`` about an axis\\n        ``N.z`` in a global frame (``N.z``, ``A.z``, and ``B.z`` are parallel).\\n\\n        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import (ObstacleSetPathway, Point,\\n        ...     ReferenceFrame)\\n        >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols\\n        >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')\\n        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')\\n        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')\\n        >>> A = N.orientnew('A', 'axis', (0, N.x))\\n        >>> B = A.orientnew('B', 'axis', (q, N.z))\\n        >>> pO = Point('pO')\\n        >>> pA, pB, pC, pD = Point('pA'), Point('pB'), Point('pC'), Point('pD')\\n        >>> pA.set_pos(pO, A.x)\\n        >>> pB.set_pos(pO, -A.y)\\n        >>> pC.set_pos(pO, B.y)\\n        >>> pD.set_pos(pO, B.x)\\n        >>> obstacle_set_pathway = ObstacleSetPathway(pA, pB, pC, pD)\\n\\n        Now create a symbol ``F`` to describe the magnitude of the (expansile)\\n        force that will be produced along the pathway.
